On 8 April 1959, *Mary K. Hawes,* a computer scientist at Burroughs Corporation, called a meeting of representatives from *academia, computer users, and manufacturers* at the University of Pennsylvania to organize a formal meeting on common business languages.[14] Representatives included Grace Hopper (inventor of the English-like data processing language FLOW-MATIC), Jean Sammet and Saul Gorn
- academics were initially involved. how did they change


Department of Defense (DoD) to sponsor an effort to create a common business language. The delegation impressed Charles A. Phillips, director of the Data System Research Staff at the DoD,[17] who thought that they "thoroughly understood" the DoD's problems.
- played a prank on them

5/28 meeting: only one person from a university as a user


"The reason it became so popular was that until then, there wasnâ€™t really anything for businesses. COBOL departed from the math heavy ones and zeros of programming languages past." https://www.tpr.org/technology-entrepreneurship/2019-05-23/how-cobol-still-powers-the-global-economy-at-60-years-old 

explicitly for business

short-range committee was made up of members representing six computer manufacturers and three government agencies
-  committee was chaired by Joseph Wegstein of the US National Bureau of Standards.
-  Grace Hopper, also served as a technical adviser to the committee

IBM's COMTRAN and FLOWmatic were competitors
- " "strong anti-IBM bias" so features nto incorporated

 Grace Hopper commented that "COBOL 60 is 95% FLOW-MATIC" and that COMTRAN had had an "extremely small" influence. Furthermore, she said that she would claim that work was influenced by both FLOW-MATIC and COMTRAN only to "keep other people happy [so they] wouldn't try to knock us out"

William Selden and Gertrude Tierney of IBM,
Howard Bromberg and Howard Discount of RCA,
Vernon Reeves and Jean E. Sammet of Sylvania Electric Products.

The COBOL community has always been isolated from the computer science community. No academic computer scientists participated in the design of COBOL: all of those on the committee came from commerce or government
