# the beauty myth
"Declining postwar birthrates and the rseulting shortage of skilled labor means that women are welcome to the labor pool: as expendable, nonunionzized, low-paid pink-collar-ghetto drudges.
​​Economist Marvin Harris described women as a "literate and docile" labor pool, and "therefore desirable candidates for the information- and people-processing jobs thrown up by modern service industries." The qualities that best serve employers in such a labor pool's workers are: low self-esteem, a tolerance for dull repetitive tasks, lack of ambition, high conformity, more respect for men (who manage them) than women (who work beside them), and little sense of control over their lives.

At a higher level, women middle managers are acceptable as long as they are male-identified and don't force too hard up against the glass ceiling; and token women at the top, in whom the female tradition has been entirely extinguished, are useful."

p.29:
aspirational ideology
"On one hand, the aspirational promise of women’s magazines that they
can do it all on their own is appealing to women who until recently
were told they could do nothing on their own. On the other, as sociologist Ruth Sidel points out, the American Dream ultimately protects the
status quo: “It discourages those at the bottom from developing a viable
political and economic analysis of the American system instead promoting a blame-the-victim mentality…a belief
that if only the individual worked harder, tried harder, he [she] would
‘make it.’” But the myth of entrepreneurial beauty, of woman against
nature, hurts women in the same way as the original model hurts
men—by leaving out the words “all else being equal.”
The transfer is complete—and, coincidentally, harmful—when
through this dream, women’s minds are persuaded to trim their desires
and self-esteem neatly into the discriminatory requirements of the
workplace, while putting the blame for the system’s failures on themselves alone"
