# Objectivity of Science
Cultural Boundaries of Science is really a book about boundaries: how do we decide what counts as science and what doesnâ€™t, for example? If that sounds relevant, I would read the introduction, which is great; the chapters are all case studies, so they might not be as necessary.

Trust in Numbers is about quantification as a tool for establishing authority. That sounds likely to be relevant to data science, so it probably is worth a look. 

You might put Objectivity by Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison


objectivity vs neutrality: Objectivity refers to an honest seeking of the truth, whatever that truth may turn out to be and regardless of what its implications might be. Neutrality refers to a preconceived "balance," which subordinates the truth to this preconception. 

(eg. neutrality is have to say equally bad things about both sides)

historical approach to objectivity
- basically objectivity is a relatively recent concept
- arose out of communication becoming easier, so objectivity was whatever could be communicated broadly / quickly
- ppl started collaborating with each other even tho they didnt know each other well
- it used to be that science was always done in consideration of the observer's ability and context
