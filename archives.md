- Finding Aid for the Seymour Benzer Papers 1942-2007; bulk 1950-2000
   Benzer was awarded the Crafoord Prize in 1993 for his pioneering genetical and neuropsychological studies on behavioral mutants in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.

- James Frederick Bonner (1910 â€“ 1996), Caltech alumnus (PhD, 1934) and professor of biology, 1938-1981. His papers include a large correspondence section with colleagues and organizations worldwide, as well as writings and talks, papers about his consultancy activities, scientific and technical files and biographical material.
- conversations with IST?
- Aron Kuppermann (1926-2011) was a leader in the field of computational chemistry During his many years at Caltech (1963-2011), Kuppermann also worked as a consultant for the World Bank on projects of Science and Technology in Brazil, China, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, and Uganda from 1983 to 2005. His papers reflect his avid interest in both scientific research and teaching.

- William J. Dreyer Papers 1955-2006
    - William Jakob Dreyer was born in Michigan and raised in Wisconsin and Oregon, with extended periods of visiting in Norway, his father's homeland. He attended Reed College (BA 1952) and the University of Washington (PhD in biochemistry, 1956). Early in his career he became interested in the molecular basis of development and heredity, and he also pioneered instruments that automated chemical analyses. After a period at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), where he worked with C. Anfinsen, G. Streisinger, and M. Nirenberg, he took a professorial appointment at Caltech in the biology division in 1963. His early work at Caltech centered on investigations of genetic coding for protein structure using immunological techniques. He proposed that genes could be reshuffled to provide additional information for the formation of proteins. With Leroy Hood and later Michael Hunkapillar he worked on the design of an automated protein sequencer and was associated with the founding of the company Applied Biosystems. Dreyer also consulted with many other biotech companies and held upwards of 20 patents on biochemical apparatus and processes. He maintained a life-long interest in the human brain and how genes program behavior. Dreyer was an early member of Caltech's innovative Beckman Institute and an enthusiastic promoter of **computer imaging for biological investigations.**
