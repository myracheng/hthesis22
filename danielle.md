# meeting 7/19
## cleaned up notes
Values I'm focused on: 
objectivity, meritocracy, hacker, military, perseverance, genius, masculinity

what is the GOAL of GHC organization
values presented to kids? like children's biographies
- the politics of representation: representation is coded as a transformative thing, but strengthens the systems/structures that harm ppl ending

- - the problem with expecting that minorities/women, once they enter that space, it iwll be transformed to be less harmful


pick 3 things or 2 things: most important things to track over time
(following ideas or institutions over time)

after the 60s when computer science becomes a very masculine field, *how women are responding to that*
- whats going on in the 70s, 80s, 90s
how did we get to the grace hopper
    the myth + what it's being used to do (defense recruiters)
    - the namesake, the desire in the 70s+ (past 50 yrs) to create more women in computer science, the values being associated with that, recruiting women in computer science into harmful corporations
         - no room to challenge what the field is doing
does GHC have discussions about transforming the values of the field?


## raw notes
what are the values?
objectivity, meritocracy, hacker, 

military

perseverance, genius, 

feminitiy ascribed to grace hopper: 
masculine
- navy admiral, 

specific goals of computer science
- what ppl are advocating inclusion of computer science, what they see women doing in those spaces
    - challenging or legitimating those values? by showing that theyre not only the purview of white/asian cishet men

for more women to be 

what is the GOAL
- 2nd wave feminism
    - women r assumed to have particular values: care, creating communities of care within harmful institutions that are masculine, competitive, etc
    - but then, tehyre arguing that women are doing the same things, and they can adopt those values, anything men can do women can do, theres no special soething they an do (3rd wave: destabilizing gender roles & binaries)
figuring out their argument for why diversity things are motivated
    - are they assumign that women have some special quality that they bring
    - greatest beneficiaries of AA are white women, 
        - what kinds of harms do white women do in these spaces

objectivity, meritocracy, military-industrial complex, individual genius, perseverance
- advocates are proproted
    - their value is "inclusion" which is part of upholding a system. crisis of legitimacy when you dont have representation

further uphold those values
- 

Golden gulag

black ppl are advancing values that harm black ppl

new narratives that are being created by the hagiography
- the politics of representation: representation is coded as a transformative thing, but strengthens the systems/structures that harm ppl ending


what are the source bases?
- engage primary sources:
    - oral history with telle, 
critically examine the grace hopper oral histories
critical analysis of biographies
    - childrens books
        trace the construction of myth : how sehs involved in the construction of grace hopper: how popular science is talkign about hre, how academics are doing stuff, how it trickles down into stem education
    how these values are presented to kids/little girls
        THESE R THE VALUES THAT U NEED TO HAVE TO BE LIKE GRACE

professional organizations:
- society of women engineers: papers from 80s, archives of professional organizations, and how they imagine why women should be in these spaces (justice spaces) : do they imagine women transforming these spaces?
    - women will make these more caring spaces
the politics of representations as its' imagined by student and political organizations during this period where diversity becomes a goal of university and corporate policy

history of AA (higher education):
- law journals

critique of diversity Walter Benn Michaels The Trouble of Diversity
- limitations of representation
- the problem with expecting that minorities/women, once they enter that space, it iwll be transformed to be less harmful

Sarah Ahmad On Being Included
- limits of politics of inclusion

technocratic feminism
 - value of technocracy
 - how r there ways to do this?

neoliberal feminism
- Sheryl sandberg "lean in"
its ok if there r billionaires, if 50\% are women, 12\% are black

this period coincides with the development of neoliberalism
- neoliberalism of stem

(these ideas take on new weight in neoliberal era)
- e.g. idea that everyone should have access to thsoe things, not just white men
- but those values still stay in place (liberalism)

neoliberal feminism 
/ 
4th wave feminism
/ 
neoliberalism in sceince

neoliberalism has come to mean so many different things, but it is useful for grouping together

pick 3 things or 2 things: most important things to track over time
(following ideas or institutions over time)


if it's about the myth of grace hopper, that iwll be very different than if it's about the professional organizations
- what the primary sources tell:
    - trade journals

values and norms in computer science

otehr ppl writing about women in the military
- analog

    - radical computer science: how is that treated in this conference
    whats the goal of having more women at facebook
        -upholding facebook's legitimacy: therefore it must be progressive and just, because it's diverse
            upholding liberalism, capitalism by diversifying
- tracking that conference on its own, 

hannah leblanc

political imperative of the project:
- how do we make CS less harmful?
    - 


should have a good amoutn of primary sources:
- treating historiographical sources as historical: participating in the construction of these narratives
