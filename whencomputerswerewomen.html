While college educated engineers considered the task of computing too tedious for them selves, it was not too tedious for the college-educated women who made up the majority of computers.18 These were not simply cases of women taking on men’s tasks, but rather of the emergence of new job definitions in light of the female workforce.</p><p>ENIAC was project by APG in Aberdeen</p><ul><li>The APG housed the army’s Ballis tic Research Laboratory (BRL), which produced range tables for gunners. During the war, BRL recruited approximately two hundred women to work as computers, hand-calculating firing tables for rockets and artillery shells</li></ul><p>the differential analyzer, slide rules, and desktop commercial calculators.27 Despite the complexities of preparing firing tables, in this feminized job category McNulty’s appointment was rated at a subprofessional grade.

While “specially selected” for a “rather important” task these women were simultaneously “not trained persons” and could not enter “fully” into the BRL’s work.</p><p>Even as the WAC courses went on, Moore School engineers were design ing a machine to automate the production of the same firing and bombing tables calculated by the human computers: the ENIAC. Engineers wanted answers faster than women could supply them using available technologies. Yet ENIAC couldn’t do everything itself.

Looking behind media accounts and later narratives of the development of ENIAC to consider primary source accounts of the work women actually performed reveals how its low-status categorization clashed with the kinds of knowledge required.
