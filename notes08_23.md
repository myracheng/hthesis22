- create specific phrase to describe a phenomenon :

Grace vs Jean:
** who invented cobol? ** (no straightforward answer)
- military infrastructure
- names on paper
- GH's association

- include notion of * evvery invention has 1 great inventor *
- and gender: but not "women's labor going unnoticed" but rather what types of labor are remembered 

Idea:
possibly trace a few diff inventions with diff creation stories? 

MC TODO: where are women innovators / stereotypes of what women bring to computing? 
- numpy controversy.
  - at what points in creation, development, use do ppl get credit ? 
    - at the point of grants, papers, etc. 

How do diff actors tell the stories of COBOL?
- Grace/Breyer vs Breyer

historiographical ways to describe innovations:
- great man's story
- the role of accident
- community-centered
--> if innnovation privileges x, then the women get edited out

MC TODO: theories of innovation and labor

MC TODO: precis (short overview of project) or proposal:
- the subject, the set of tools. e.g. multiple narratives --> create typology of different stories and how they correlate
    - can be concrete, ex.  include X book and X document

while abroad: "postcards to my future projects"

2 or 3 inmportant strands throughout the literature, how have ppl grappled with it differently
