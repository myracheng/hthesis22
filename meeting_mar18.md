# meeting with maura 3/18


---------

writing the rationale for thesis project
- explain why the courses that i took are related to this topic. kousser, claire, maura
h 136: next step

hannah leblanc
- teaching classses on sex and gender / race / feminist in science


- ee
- human behavior: rockefeller
foundational push for social control

from early on, big AI was being funded by 3rd model.

do we take for granted lily kay's rockefeller interested in social control
1. foundation - kay
2. federal government/ the State - leslie
3. the corporation - can we find the moment where these 2 strands interact in the
emergence of AI. bendy trajectories, at multiple points, who is intersecting

at first federal + foundational , and then later gets connected to 
    - dartmouth: from the beginning very beginning
    - the startup in this era. history of science literature that helps us contextualize
    how ppl r getting invovled. things r being experimented with

- interview shuki bruck
being the sort of person that people want to give/tell things to

narrowing it down: focus on a psecific place/technology/lab

resituate the history of the advent of startups as not primiarly entreprenural but actually
intersecting between enterpreneurialand academic sectors.
emphasizing importance of connections /collaborations of academy. how deepy embedded these 
entrepreneural strcutures are in research procsses now.

like "racist behavior isnt anti american. it is american"

tech research isn't bad when its entrepreneural. it has always BEEN entrepreneurial.
drawback is studying businesses :P

the business of making profitable knowledge. business is fueled by defense funding, by 
corporate investment, by startup success/venture capital, by academic institutions. all
of these things are interconnected and have been for a very long period of time.
startups are not cool innovative business that plucky SV ppl. latest iteration of a model that has been a backbone to sustaining academic inquiry in various sciences. today when we thiink
about the infiltration of bi tech corproate intersets, we have to understand that this is not a problem that we address by thinking about big tech but instead larger history. the startup SEEMS new but is actually a new iteration of circulation of ideas,funds, research initiatives

- bell labs heavily collaborated with military early on

business history critical theory

tag things with dates / backdating

70s80s as the base of inquiry and keep reaching backwards and forwards

-> no actually the 60s? i guess? idk

what form the past matters to understand this moment. and what part of it matters for the future

social cohorts
    - how a historian might spin a tale of why its important that ppl are spinning tale
    - how does existence of cohort that exists these social fields reflect the institutional backers
    AND their circulation in/out/of these institutions

see shuki bruck as different narrative of the same reality. the story youre telling
vs the one that they have been telling yourselves

what does need to stand? needing stuff to corrorbate / contextualize it

maura will send business history articles
    - naomi lamoraough:
     Insider Lending:  Banks, Personal Connections, and Economic Development in Industrial New England
        corproations and banks in new england history. examples of why american brand of competition
        was actualyl just a bunch of ppl breaking rules for each other

shuki is ee and info study link
nat: link between the biological and ai fields. whether or not / to what extent the
story that kay is telling reads to her
