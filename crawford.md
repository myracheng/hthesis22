Now a
small number of powerful technology corporations deploy AI
systems at a planetary scale, and their systems are once again
hailed as comparable or even superior to human intelligence

his belief that the mind is like a computer, and vice
versa, has “infected decades of thinking in the computer and
cognitive sciences,” creating a kind of original sin for the field.15


And due to
the capital required to build AI at scale and the ways of seeing
that it optimizes AI systems are ultimately designed to serve
existing dominant interests. In this sense, artificial intelligence
is a registry of power

25 One of
the founders of artificial intelligence and early experimenter
in facial recognition, Woody Bledsoe, put it most bluntly: “in
the long run, AI is the only science.”26 This is a desire not to
create an atlas of the world but to be the atlas—the dominant
way of seeing

The deep
interconnections between the tech sector and the military are
now being reined in to fit a strong nationalist agenda

eckman:
His work is connected to U.S.
intelligence funding of the human sciences during the Cold
War through foundational work in the field of computer vision
to the post-9/11 security programs employed to identify terrorists and right up to the current fashion for AI-based emotion
recognition

that there is a small number of distinct and
universal emotional categories, that we involuntarily reveal
these emotions on our faces, and that they can be detected by
machines.

This desire for universality has an
important bearing on why these theories are widely applied in
AI emotion recognition systems today: it offered a small set of
principles that could be applied everywhere, a simplification of
complexity that was easily replicable

Ekman’s
door in the form of the Advanced Research Projects Agency
(ARPA), a research arm of the Department of Defense. Looking back on this period, he admitted, “It wasn’t my idea to do
this [affect research]. I was asked—pushed. I didn’t even write
the research proposal. It was written for me by the man who
gave me the money to do it.”30 In 1965, he was researching nonverbal expression in clinical settings and seeking funding to develop a research program at Stanford University. He arranged a
meeting in Washington, D.C., with Lee Hough, head of ARPA’s
behavioral sciences division.31 Hough was uninterested in how
Ekman described his research, but he saw potential in understanding cross-cultural nonverbal communication.3

. It turns out that Hough wanted to
distribute his money quickly to avoid suspicion from Senator
Frank Church, who had caught Hough using social science research as a cover for acquiring information in Chile that could
be used to overthrow its left-wing government under President Salvador Allende


Because facial recognition emerged as a foundational
application for artificial intelligence in the 1960s, it is not
surprising that early researchers working in this field found
common cause with Ekman’s approach to analyzing faces.

Snowden archive:
most specific details about how machine
learning began to be used in the intelligence sector, as led by
some of the wealthiest governments in the world.


The U.S. intelligence agencies are the old guards of big
data. Along with the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency, they have been major drivers of AI research since the
1950s. As the historian of science Paul Edwards describes in
The Closed World, military research agencies actively shaped
the emerging field that would come to be known as AI from
its earliest days.9

The Office of Naval Research, for example,
partly funded the first Summer Research Project on Artificial
Intelligence at [[dartmouth]] College in 1956
(from closed world)



military priorities of command and control, automation, and surveillance profoundly shaped what AI was to
become. The tools and approaches that came out of DARPA
funding have marked the field, including computer vision, automatic translation, and autonomous vehicles. But these technical methods have deeper implications.

classification thinking permeates AI

the growing commercial surveillance sector, which
aggressively markets its tools and platforms to police departments and public agencies. 

To paraphrase the theorist Benjamin Bratton, the state is taking on the armature of a
machine because the machines have already taken on the roles
and register of the state
    Bratton, Stack, 151


But the rhetoric around artificial intelligence is much
starker: we are repeatedly told that we are in an AI war. The
dominant objects of concern are the supernational efforts of the
United States and China, with regular reminders that China has
stated its commitment to be the global leader in AI.

practices of China’s leading tech companies, including Alibaba,
Huawei, Tencent, and ByteDance, are often framed as direct
Chinese state policy and thus seen as inherently more threatening than U.S. private actors such as Amazon and Facebook,
even though the lines between state and corporate imperatives
and incentives are complexly intertwined.

the liberal vision of global digital citizens engaging
as equals in the abstract space of networks has shifted toward a
paranoid vision of defending a national cloud against the racialized enemy

Carter played a significant role in bringing Silicon Valley
into closer relationship to the military, convincing tech companies that national security and foreign policy depended on
American dominance of AI. 
19 He called this the Third Offset
strategy.

. The Third, according to Carter, should be a combination of AI, computational warfare, and robots.22 But unlike the NSA, which already had robust surveillance capabilities, the U.S. military lacked the AI resources, expertise, and
infrastructure of America’s leading technology companies.23
In 2014, Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work outlined the
Third Offset as an attempt to “exploit all the advances in artificial intelligence and autonomy.”24



To build AI war machines, the Department of Defense
would need gigantic extractive infrastructures. Yet in order to
gain access to highly paid engineering labor and sophisticated
development platforms, partnering with industry was necessary. The NSA had paved the way with systems like prism,
both working with and secretly infiltrating telecommunications and technology companies.25 But these more covert approaches faced renewed political pushback after the Snowden
disclosures. Congress passed the USA Freedom Act in 2015,
which introduced some limitations on the NSA’s access to realtime data from Silicon Valley. Yet the possibility for a larger
military-industrial complex around data and AI remained tantalizingly close. Silicon Valley had already built and monetized
the logics and infrastructures of AI required to drive a new offset

have to convince tech sector that creating the infrastructure of warfare would be worth
it without alienating their employees and deepening public
mistrust


n April 2017, the Department of Defense published a memo
announcing the Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team,
code-named Project Maven.

Avoid at all costs any mention or implication of AI,” Li wrote in an email to Google colleagues that was
later leaked. “Weaponized AI is probably one of the most sen
sitized topics of AI—if not the most. This is red meat to the
media to find all ways to damage Google.”3
    - WTF she also did sailors lololol

eric shmdit: shift to to a debate over whether AI could help to “kill people
correctly,” was quite strategic.
     It moved the focus away from
the foundational ethics of AI as a military technology toward
questions of precision and technical accuracy
    - ethical ai presumes this (surveillance is the starting point when u begin in collab w/ military)
    - history: not inevitable. bc situated in this field that was inclined toward surveillance.



This represents a shift away from traditional policing toward the goals more associated with military intelligence
infrastructure
