in 1987, the average for women graduating with Computer Science degrees hit its peak at 38%. Furthermore, “computer science was the fastest growing college major and popular STEM discipline among women from the 1970s until the 1980s.”

- The shift was first seen in academia. A study that looked at the computer science program at Carnegie Mellon University found that women were disparaged and disadvantaged in the classroom because, with the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, male students were more likely to arrive to college with some computing experience

book: Mothers in Academia by Mari Castañeda and Kirsten Isgro, eds. New York: Columbia University Press, 2013.

Academic Motherhood: How Faculty Manage Work and Family by Kelly Ward and Lisa Wolf-Wendel. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 2012.
    - in the small but growing body of literature about mothers in academia, they found that “academic motherhood experiences have been underreported and those available are negative in tone.” And yet, they describe being besieged by graduate students and junior faculty desperate for advice about how to balance work and family life in academia. Both authors are now full professors; they know that success like theirs is possible and initiated this study in an effort to provide analysis and advice for women trying to navigate the often contradictory demands of academic work and parenthood.
    - The authors are determined not to seem to be saying, “We did it, so you can too!” On the contrary, their research was profoundly motivated by the desire to change how provosts, deans, department chairs, colleagues, and female faculty members view questions of motherhood and work-family balance. They want to move the discussion from a “narrative of constraint” to a “narrative of possibility.”
    - many women also mention not knowing about leave policies, cobbling together affordable child-care solutions for themselves, or trying to time their pregnancies so that their babies will be born in the summertime.
