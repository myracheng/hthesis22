# Meeting with Peter March 16
when does data science start
how distinct is it from information/cybernetics/signal processing/control engineering/"""computer science""

do you want to bound by time? archives wont have newer /present stuff
studying the presnet: surveys/interviews/newspapers
-pick one particular component [time period]
- think about it as a chapter of a book 
- History of coporate relationships in CS research for the history of computing
-imagine a larger project, 

(Vs do the whole thing in a superficial way)

carver mead 
- hardware engineer / microchip design
- started a lot of companies...  but small companies

caltech archives does not have a lot on CS/engineering

-gilbert mccann : dk
- compiler design, died young in a bizarre
-Jan L. A. van de Snepscheut https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD11xx/EWD1177.html

what was the role of corporations in caltech as an institution developing computer science?
- records of the office of the president (not open for 25 yrs)
- grants
- 
leslie is focused on DOD. --> corproate relationships with boeing/ lockheed <-->DOD <-> GALCIT
similarity to the story of computing : DARPA Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (dept of DOD)


- how did EE come to be overtaken by a narrower computational range of questions - data science?? & the rise of computer science. EE gets renamed to EECS.

the foundation of CS is in EE. becomes a huge field due to corporate funding and 

- when are categories actor categories vs analytic categories? data science as an actors category is only 12 yrs old. 
- how did big tech start shaping researcH?? how do these questions connect
- google ngram viewer: 

berkeley: https://eecs.berkeley.edu/about/history
- considered CS to be part of natural sciences, not engineering. -shifted it back 5 yrs later
not the caltech model

history of computing is not about history of computer science. the business history of who built computers and software, and this doesnt happen at universities.

these partnerships r standard now. what did the relationships between universties and computing corporations look like in x time? 
-> my argument is that this is not new, 
- how much are you trying to exist on leaning secondary literature

shuki bruck and IST

picking particular univerisites/time periods

the government as a partner: ENIAC in 1940s
first programmable digital electronic computer

history of internet: corp + govt
history of 

i talked to archivists, can i have ur oral history / can i ask u about history of IST

cybernetics: started at wwii, premise: useful analogies between different types of systems (organisms/ecosystems || social systems like econ and organizations || natural systems like minds || computers). positive and negative feedback. circular causality in a system

norbert weiner: point an anti-aircraft and shoot it down. learn the behavior of the pilto
idea of information as entropy, mathematically quantifiably thing. 

Heims, Steve Joshua (1980). John Von Neumann and Norbert Wiener: From Mathematics to the Technologies.

ussr chile france
- chile: tracking goods/factory production/factory needs. computerize this: control center with people with teletype machines. model flow of materials thourhgout the system. stafford bier: management scholar. described himself as "management cybernetics"
- cybernetics influence on french social theory

shaped by political economy -> everything before is abt government, now it's about corporations
