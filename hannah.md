  - --> rhetorical analysis of why she is appealing to different sectors, while other "feminist" things (e.g. better working conditions, fixing economic ineq) are not
    - corporate/liberal feminism, military figure

- efforts to get women into coding: imagining a better way of talking about STEM? TODO
  - what anrrative would i want about getting women in STEM
    - want to be inclusive and not harm marginalized populations

- How can we celebrate innovation without the "singular lone genius"? Yet acknowledge various contributions?
  - Acknowledge the conditions that made things possible
    - in my history thesis, i will study the factors (beside the person himself/herself) that made particular innovations possible .
      - e.g. military funding, drove stuff cuz huge amount of $

--> other things in service of that one

how they r presented ot ppl trying to work in these fields, to kids, etc.

what would u want someone whos read your thesis to do?
- efforts to get women into coding: imagining a better way of talking about STEM?
  - what anrrative would i want about getting women in STEM
  - and history of sciecnes
What kinds of sources would you enojy working with?
  - oral history?

trying to create a pool of cheap labor for industry and military by getting code into schools
- who does this serve?

Carnegie mellon: deliberate effort for gender equity/parity
- overhauled intro class, huge success
  - growth mindset vs fixed mindset
    - ppl who are socialized who can think 


Why do we care about women in STEM?
- what's driving this worthy goal?
  - some of the ways that it's talked about reveal different desires of different actors.
    - why does Google and universities vs grace hopper want more women in stem?
  - celebrating "exceptional women" : they didnt need extra support. the problem is inspiration, getting ppl in the door rather than changing the structural conditions.

we care about innovation, but what makes the world goes around is maintaining existing systems
- who gets celebrated?

how social values are in scientific and technical fields
    Helen Longino, Fate of Knowledge

homogenous fields
- who does stuff?

Feminism for the 99%

celebrate innovation but not "singular lone genius"
- early modern science:
  - few great individual thinkers --> conditions that make these momentous things possible


A Vast Machine: Computer Models, Climate Data, and the Politics of Global Warming (Infrastructures) Illustrated Edition
- the infrastructures that make things possible
- things that are in place to allow these innovations happen

military funding:
what are the conditions?
- was it a huge amt of funding, or does it have to be attached to war/military

- major moment of innovation


Feminism for the 99%
Hannah LeBlanc to Everyone (1:40 PM)
https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/691678
Dedicated to enabling a smattering of
privileged women to climb the corporate ladder
and the ranks of the military, it propounds a
market-centered view of equality that dovetails
perfectly with the prevailing corporate enthusiasm
for "diversity
. Rather
than seeking to abolish social hierarchy, it aims to
"diversify" it, "empowering" "talented" women to
rise to the top. 

Thesis 5: Gender oppression in capitalist
societies is rooted in the subordination of
social reproduction to production for profit.
