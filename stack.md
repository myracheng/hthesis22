# stack of software and sovereigneity
 new geopolitical theory for the age of global computation and algorithmic governance.


this book proposes a specific model for the design of political geography tuned to this era of planetary-scale computation

Today the authority of states, drawn from the rough consensus of the Westphalian political geographic diagram, is simultaneously never more entrenched and ubiquitous and never more obsolete and brittle.

The capacity of the state to enforce those same territorial claims is not simply undone;
indeed, it is also reinforced by the same processes of delinking sovereignty and geography that states themselves have innovated


it is a scale of technology that comes to absorb functions of the state and the work of governance

. If new means for perception and surveillance are made available (to see new spaces, new scales, new traces, new crimes), then governance — and the state in particular — will conform itself to the vacuum opened up by new vision machines and to the demands of whatever is now available to observe and control

the ultimate effect of how increasingly powerful technologies of perception, sensing, detection, parsing, and processing all react together to enforce design and retrain governance in their own images

the machine as the state

computing machines into platform systems not only reflects, manages, and enforces forms of sovereignty; it also generates them in the first place.

That war is less between two superpowers (or proxies for
them) than between two irreconcilable logics of how polities and publics are convened
according to what sovereign spaces
-  One of these sees “ the Internet ”as an extension of
the body of the state (or subservient to it) and another sees “ the Internet ”as a living,
quasi-autonomous (if privately controlled and profited) transterritorial civil society
that produces, defends, and demands rights on its own

For this, Google is a nonstate
actor operating with the force of a state, but unlike modern states, it is not defined
by a single specific territorial contiguity. It is a US-headquartered corporation but *also a transnational actor that has taken on many traditional functions of nation-states.*

overlapping layers, claims, and networks as basis of an emergent order

The Stack,
as examined here, comprises six interdependent layers: Earth, Cloud, City, Address, Interface, User

In an age of planetary-scale computation, what is “ sovereignty ”and what is the future political geography, especially as the former is separated from the latter?

Finally, to Clinton ’ s half-formed question, what is the architecture of the emergent geopolitics of this software society? What alignments, components, foundations, and apertures?

 the appetite of the state is rejuvenated by the same processes of computation that delink modern sovereignty and geography and challenge
that particular consensual framework.

 politics as infrastructure, systems as law, totalities
as site condition, supply chains as ecologies, and energy as money


## nomos of the cloud

state sovereignty is drawn out by rules of an international system that is itself guaranteed by the federation of states

state would have a right to the legitimate exercise of control and governance within an exclusive geographic domain, usually of land, including certain monopolies over legitimate violence and the recognition of and by international law

7. The Nomos of the Cloud? 31 
The United States is the sole sovereign in the Western Hemisphere and its will is fiat.

n. Even in the absence of a proper nomos, they congeal layer by layer into a metastructural order of a different governing order: a machine that is a state held together by deciding the spaces of technical exceptions as much as legal ones.

8. A Google Grossraum? 34 
Does “ Google ”(literally the cloud platform and the geography defined by it) represent something like a Monroe Doctrine of the Cloud, filling out and supervising a domain extended well beyond the North American continental shelf, across a more comprehensive composite spectrum

The Stack appears to be American, and as of now, it both is and is not (it is also mostly Chinese), but in the long term, this identity may actually prove far less significant than it might seem today. The Stack will also change what “ American ”means in the first place, as the identity of a geopolitical actor and as a governmental service platform, and in doing so, The Stack as a whole may resemble that new national definition less and less.

25. The First Sino-Google War of 2009 

territorial domain of nations was always defended by the naval capacity over the omnidirectional glacis of the ocean in light of Google ’ s filed patent on water-based data centers

This will redraw the practical boundaries between open and curated computational services, public and private data, state and corporate geography, User and service, and Interface and infrastructure

Today contested lines on maps still symbolize geopolitical tensions over sovereign
- google has become the sovereign

States move into the Cloud. We see this in guises from the benign to the sinister, from progressive gestures of information democratization like data.gov to the troubling surveillance armatures associated with the National Security Agency, the Patriot Act, and superjurisdiction over international Cloud data. 34 From the prosaic gathering and reportage of information to its citizens, on the one hand, to the clandestine hoarding of massive troves of data about its citizens (and other countries ’citizens), on the other, states in the cloud transform what states can see, and what “ seeing like a state ” (and listening and sensing like a state) actually entails. 35 With this shift in perceptual techniques, habits, and dispositions, states are inspired to look for some things and not others. The work of contemporary governance is transformed toward the management of multiple, irregular, asymmetric layers of Cloud platforms, and as the “ eyes ”of the state evolve, its bones and blood will follow


Clouds become de facto states

Cloud platforms not only have geopolitical ramifications and implications; they are a geopolitical condition and constitution in their own right

How should we imagine the role of a geopolitical actor with the future scale, program, and capacity of, say, Google or Apple or Alibaba, as well as the smaller players that will fill out the space cleared by similar enterprises?

#### google
come close to Google in its universal, even cosmic ambition

geopolitical framework

Google is also perceived as too linked to the US federal system, and both fairly and unfairly is held in suspicion throughout the world, especially in China and Russia, as a stalking horse for the US State and Defense departments ’security apparatuses. [63]

, Julian Assange characterizes it as “ an attempt by Google to position itself as America ’ s geopolitical visionary — the one company that can answer the question, ‘ Where should America go

Schmidt and Cohen ’ s book, Google is but a useful and agnostic enabler of the democratic project

Every time we execute a search query, Google is not only working for us; we are also working for Google


## cloud layer
As the nomos of the Cloud rotates from a twodimensional map to a vertical, sectional stack, its topography is shaped by the multiplication and superimposition of layers of sovereign claims over the same site, person, and event. The microenclaves that it spawns are a pixelated patchwork of discontiguous partial interiors and enclaves

The Google-China conflict is exemplary of this interweaving. It can be interpreted reasonably as geopolitical conflict between empires, both leveraging their different state-corporate-military-information network systems to claim the free soil of planetary computational territory. It is more fundamental than that between two megastate actors; it was and is a conflict not only over the right to control search engine results, but indeed over the predominance of two different modes of sovereignty
