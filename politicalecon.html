If we set our time machine back to 1971, we’d find a leading corporate lawyer earnestly writing that, “As every business executive knows, few elements of American society today have as little influence in government as the American businessman, the corporation, or even the millions of corporate stockholders. If one doubts this, let him undertake the role of ‘lobbyist’ for the business point of view before Congressional committees.” then rapid growth in 80s and 90s Those lobbyists would go on to spend the 1980s teaching companies about the importance of political engagement. But it would take time for them to become fully convinced. As one company lobbyist I interviewed for my new book, The Business of America Is Lobbying, told me, “When I started [in 1983], people didn’t really understand government affairs. They questioned why you would need a Washington office, what does a Washington office do? I think they saw it as a necessary evil. All of our competitors had Washington offices, so it was more, well we need to have a presence there and it’s just something we had to do.”</p></blockquote><h3 id="business-insider">business insider</h3><p>excerpted at : <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-corporations-turned-into-political-beasts-2015-4">https://www.businessinsider.com/how-corporations-turned-into-political-beasts-2015-4</a></p><blockquote><p>Facing a common enemy (government and labor), they hung together so they wouldn’t hang separately. But as the labor movement weakened and government became much more pro-industry, companies continued to invest in politics, becoming more comfortable and more aggressive. Rather than seeing government as a threat, they started looking to government as potential source of profits and assistance. As companies devoted more resources to their own lobbying efforts, they increasing sought out their own narrow interests. As corporate lobbying investments have expanded, they have become more particularistic and more proactive. They have also become more pervasive, driven by the growing competitiveness of the process to become more aggressive.</p></blockquote><p>From a book review:</p><blockquote><p>During the past forty years, wealthy special interests have managed to create a cycle of increasing influence on US government leading to ever-increasing inequality (as well as decreasing protection for the environment and the economy). This influence is exerted by a variety of means, such as lobbying, campaign contributions, think tanks, university institutes, media outlets, and quasi-grass roots groups, all generously funded by the fruits of inequality. Author Lee Drutman focuses on the increasing importance of corporate lobbying as a component of this special interest influence on government. Lobbying by politically active groups increased from $200 million to $3.55 billion per year from 1983 to 2010 (corrected for inflation), of which more than three-quarters represented corporate America.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Prior to the 1970s, few corporations had their own lobbyists, and the trade associations that represented them were of limited scope. In the late 1960s and early 1970s congress passed a series of environmental and consumer regulations that business lacked the capacity to stop. This awakened the sleeping giant. Between 1971 and 1982, the number of firms with registered lobbyists in Washington grew from 175 to 2,445. The number of registered lobbyists in Washington reached a peak of 14,849 in 2007. Corporations’ approach to lobbying was initially merely reactive against their perceived enemies in labor and government. But as labor was defeated and government became much more pro-industry, corporate lobbying became more proactive and particularistic to exploit government as a source of profits and assistance. Also, lobbying increased from its own internal momentum (stickiness). Once fixed start-up costs were met, marginal costs for additional lobbying declined. Lobbyists themselves drove the process with the advantage of asymmetric information to sell their services to managers.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Corporations now have more political power than at any time since the 1920s and are favored by the status quo. Any major policy change now generally requires mostly one-sided lobbying, which is increasingly unlikely in today’s dense and competitive lobbying environment. The need to respond to many lobbyists also makes legislation more complicated. This complication hides the growing tendency to redistribute resources upward to the wealthy and the organized. Also, it overwhelms the limited capabilities of congressional staffers who must then rely on lobbyist specialists for information and drafting of bills. This imbalance is exacerbated by the siphoning off of more and more talent from the public sector by the much higher salaries in the lobbying industry. Between 2001 and 2011, almost 5,400 congressional staffers had registered as lobbyists with increased salaries of up to $200,000 to $300,000 per year.</p></blockquote></div><div class="metadata"><div class="date" title="Zettel date"><time datetime="2021-03-17T20:17">2021-03-17</time></div></div></article><nav class="ui bottom attached icon compact inverted menu teal" id="neuron-nav-bar"><!--replace-start-9--><a class="item" href="." title="Home"><i class="home icon"></i></a><!--replace-end-9--><a class="item" href="https://github.com/myracheng/hthesis22/edit/master/./politicalecon.md" title="Edit this page"><i class="edit icon"></i></a><a class="right item" href="impulse" title="Open Impulse"><i class="wave square icon"></i></a></nav></div></div><!--replace-end-6--><!--replace-end-3--><!--replace-end-2--><div class="ui center aligned container footer-version"><div class="ui tiny image"><a href="https://neuron.zettel.page"><img alt="logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srid/neuron/master/assets/neuron.svg" title="Generated by Neuron 1.9.35.3" /></a></div></div></div></body></html>
