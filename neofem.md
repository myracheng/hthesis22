this emergent feminism is predicated on the erasure of the
issues that concern the overwhelming majority of women in the USA and across
the globe.6 In addition, there have been debates about the increasing
compatibility of mainstream feminism with the market values of neoliberalism

Each woman’s success becomes a feminist success, which is
then attributed to the USA’s enlightened political order, as well as to its moral
and political superiority.

Fraser claims that second-wave feminism’s ultimate
privileging of recognition (i.e. identity claims) over redistribution (i.e.
economic justice) is responsible for the convergence of contemporary feminism
with neoliberal capitalism. 
- crit: to place the blame on the shoulders of second-wave feminism is, as Ozlem Aslan and Zeynep Gambetti have convincingly argued, to ‘misrepresent the “cunning of history,”’ while subscribing to a causal view of the past that ‘constructs unitary subjects’

Yet, in contrast to both
Friedan and Wolf, Lean In’s focus is decidedly not on confronting or changing
social pressures, but rather on what ‘women can change themselves,’ their
‘internal obstacles’

This subject willingly
and forcibly acknowledges continued gender inequality but, as I show, her
feminism is so individuated that it has been completely unmoored from any
notion of social inequality and consequently cannot offer any sustained analytic
of the structures of male dominance, power, or privilege

This amorphous ‘ambition gap’ very quickly comes to stand in for
inequality, radically reducing inequality to the absence of women in positions
at the top. Consequently, other classic liberal feminist goals, such as fair

public sphere are expediently elided, while climbing the power hierarchy

these
lean in groups are geared to encourage women to help ‘play the corporate game
more deftly’ (McRobbie 2013, p. 24)

The very conception of encouraging
women in these groups to ‘lean in’ to their individual careers is antithetical to
working together towards any common goal.

simply claiming that this discourse is not really
feminist or constitutes some sort of backlash against ‘true’ feminism is too easy
and, I believe, misguided, both because such a claim assumes that there is one
true definition of feminism (and that ‘we’ have or know it), and because it misses
the opportunity to understand the kind of cultural work the emergence of
neoliberal feminism – which tracts like Lean In and ‘Why Women Still Can’t
Have It All’ reflect and (re)produce – is currently ‘doing

since it becomes one more domain that neoliberal governmentality colonizes

Sandberg’s and Slaughter’s manifestos have also been
criticized for advocating a “trickle-down” corporate feminism (Eisenstein
2013; see also Huffer 2013).

Scholars have already outlined in detail the processes by which mainstream
liberal feminism is converging with neoliberalism (Fraser 2013; Orloff and
