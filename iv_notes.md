On scientific authority see Thomas F. Gieryn, Cultural Boundaries of Science: Credibility on the Line (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999); Theodore M. Porter, Trust in Numbers: The Pursuit of Objectivity in Science and Public Life (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1995); and Robert N. Proctor, Value-Free Science? Purity and Power in Modern Knowledge (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1991). On social science and reform see Robert Bannister, Sociology and Scientism: The American Quest for Objectivity, 1880–1940 (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1987); Mary O. Furner, Advocacy and Objectivity: A Crisis in the Professionalization of American Social Science, 1865–1905 (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1975); Thomas L. Haskell, The Emergence of Professional Social Science: The American Social Science Association and the Nineteenth-Century Crisis of Authority (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1977); Ellen Herman, The Romance of American Psychology: Political Culture in the Age of Experts (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995); Dorothy Ross, The Origins of American Social Science (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991); and Mark C. Smith, Social Science in the Crucible: The American Debate over Objectivity and Purpose, 1918–1941 (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 1994)

Ted Porter: Insane asylums + use of statistics to justify the existence of them. Very generous and collegial and scholarly
More pertinent to the modern age. What is the new take on science and credibility in the modern age. 

## Meeting notes:
* Is the field of computer science and knowledge shaped by needs of corporations?
	* ml*ai is shaping the discipline
	* And its meeting other fields
	* Analogous of individualization of consumer experiences
		* Each field has its own version of this, but it thinks of tiself, but its actually sucking at the teat of ML
			* Mass production of milk :p
* Find a neuroscience lab that is engaging in this (Perona aws)
* GOOGLE in your brain!

Cotton candy - nodes, stick on these nodes. Thats the info that we want inside of your nodes. As we find more and more connections, it will become clear what the center is. Look for information on how we can gain observations of these points.
	Combination of reading + poking around in current world

## Todos:
* Berkeley, stanford, caltech archives
	* pick sections of books and find the specific sources → look for sources adjacent to them. * 
* Continue wartime reading
* Revise description and email to maura
* Start building cotton candy web
* Science and credibility - ask peter

Nationalism and Culture Rudolf Rocker
https:/theanarchistlibrary.org/library/rudolf-rocker-nationalism-and-culture.pdf
Zettlekasten * onenote
Horizontal and vertical connections. Ways to think about subjects and places and times
Roam?
Have separate notebooks. Sources and what the connections are. Analog web structure. Everything be in google docs. Search 1 document, source that thinks about those connections


Gabe rosenberg
“The Airing of Grievances: Are the humanities bullshit?"
Claire, danielle, jen dinner. Claire said caltech had amazon-sponsored lab
The extent to which ppl in the academy have no idea that this is happening

Nationalism and Culture Rudolf Rocker: Cultural production and national identity* how political sources mobilize cultural sources for fascist*self-centered *self-preserving reasons

Bourne: Dont have to rely on these ppl as experts. 
Talk about the *contexts in which tehy’re writing*: anarchist in Nazi germany, lefitist in US writing about pre-WWI*WWI
Moments where technology and culture are being mobilized in the political realm. How were these people conceiving these things use that coenception to reiiamgien the relationship between the cultural sphere and the corporate sphere
Science in universities vs scientific university. 
Where are amazon google involved? Is it primarily science universities? Is it possible that theyre 
Stanford: traditionally conservative nad marketmotivated intellectual profile, silicon valley, ethical climate

Stanford archives: has a ton of stuff online
Inventing the ideas of consulting firm
Poke around and see whats available
H 136
Assess what we can know about an archive
Dont need to do particular archival research now
Caltech is digitizing stuff on request

Hannah leblanc postdoc: Stem and inequality nutrition and protein supplements
History : mobilization of food production in WWII and cold war
Condition of science in that period
Agricultural research in land-grand universities
Research processes at universities

*Keep it in california for logistical reasons*
* *Stanford, Berkeley, Caltech + Amazon & Google | Time periods: WWII into Coldwar and current day back into 1980s*

	* *Moments at the edge of timeframe. What are turning points in WWII story that are useful anchors for the story. And beyond the present day, what are sites of current development that indicate the future directions of this trajectory (fintech (upstart*personal loans*payment systems <- wechat), neuroscience)*

	* 	* *In these 3 environments, what factors remain consistent vs different*

		* *Answering to UC regents and political representatives*

		* *There are ppl who are actually watching them*

* *Separate sections*documents how they compare to one another*

	* *E.g. Weapons production for WWI: y*n. Cooperation w* google: which labs*

		* *Direct axes of comparison*

			* *Find some prof at stanford, who did smth to do with war who also did smth to do with corporations (his lab shifted)*

				* *Everything else is a reflection fo that*

		* *Explicit comparisons, meaningful movement across time and space. A strand that traverses all of those spaces*

			* *Move through those spaces and reference laterally the comparisons*

			* *E.g. guy at stanford, went to Caltech who go to lecture*


*Current world of data science research + books that I’ve read: who r the main characters*lightning rods.*
