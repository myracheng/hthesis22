Part of the complexity of dismantling white supremacy is that people of colour, though marginalized within a white supremacist society, might also be complicit in and/or actively contributing to perpetuating norms and behaviours that map onto a white supremacy culture.

are implicitly or explicitly white supremacist. 

t unconsciously use these characteristics as
their norms and standards make it difficult, if not
impossible, to open the door to other cultural norms
and standards.

many organizations
that claim to be multicultural in fact require new
participants to adapt or conform to already existing
(i.e. white supremacy culture) cultural norms.

Being
able to identify and name the cultural norms and
standards the group wants is a critical step in
building a truly multicultural organization.

— Is there a difference in how people of colour in the group
experience these cultural beliefs and how white people do?
What could we learn from that?
— What steps could we take to change these features in a
day-to-day way? What solutions could the antidotes offer us?
Are we ready and willing to do that?

### Perfectionism*
— Perfectionism is closely linked to a culture of blame. It relies on guilt, fear and shame 
### Concentration of Power
Ideas of leadership are rooted in a culture of 'leader worship,' conceiving of leaders as saviours and/or
heroes;

Those with power think they are capable of making decisions for and in the interests of
those without power, often without meaningfully consulting the people being affected;
— Those with power often don’t think it is important or necessary to unders

The organization spends significant time and energy trying to protect power as it exists

### Right to Comfort
The belief that those with power have a right to emotional and psychological comfort.
This belief is broadly related to another characteristic to be discussed, the valuing of ‘logic’
over emotion;

### indiviualism
Recognition is often done on an individual basis. Those in positions of power (both formal
and informal) often get most or all of the credit, thus invisibilizing other contributors;

Individualistic organizational culture creates a lack of accountability as the group values
those who can get things done on their own without supervision or guidance;

, individualism is strongly linked to the meritocracy myth. Meritocracy
is the idea that power, privilege, and wealth are afforded to those who have earned it on
the basis of individual achievement, hard work, and/or inherent superiority. Operating
within this rationale is the belief that those who are disenfranchised, powerless, and/or
marginalized are as such due to a personal failure, a refusal to work hard, and/or inherent
inferiority. The belief in meritocracy handily erases structural inequality, that has a real
impact on people’s power and position today.

### Progress is Bigger
Progress is understood as organizational expansion (e.g. adding staff or projects) or the
ability to serve more people, regardless of how well the community is being served;
