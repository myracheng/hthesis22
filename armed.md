# Armed with Expertise Book

### Ch 1 gray area
*  Directors priorities: doesnt believe in “pure intellectual curiosity”, “abhorred knowledge pursue df for its own sake American Univeristy president Hurst Anderson embraed SORO as part of his broader educational vision 27

	* How do these priorities get decided? For universities in general?

* “Crucial social-scientific problem: building modern nation state

	* How do these vague terms get used today

	* Larger behavioral scieniifc goal of determining the universal laws of human and social behavior

* “Pure research was in fact research of little consequence” Ray Hackman

→ Cold War: this distinction b/w pure and applied is like distinction b/w war & peace
“Acclimiated themselves to the spread of american power by arguing that they acted with the best of intentions” 35
Hid the fact of military influence over scholarhsip and policy - even from themselves

### Ch 2
* Gray area/relationship b/w expertise and democracy preceded the rise of militarization.

	* Generations sought to elevate politics to the level of science

	* “The basis of modern scientific authority lies in the ostensibly objective and disinterested character of its empirical claims”

	* *Using tech approaches to history*

		* Transform questions of power and politics into subjects of rational, value-neutral inquiry

* *On scientific authority see Thomas F. Gieryn, Cultural Boundaries of Science: Credibility on the Line (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999); Theodore M. Porter, Trust in Numbers: The Pursuit of Objectivity in Science and Public Life (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1995); and Robert N. Proctor, Value-Free Science? Purity and Power in Modern Knowledge (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1991). On social science and reform see Robert Bannister, Sociology and Scientism: The American Quest for Objectivity, 1880–1940 (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1987); Mary O. Furner, Advocacy and Objectivity: A Crisis in the Professionalization of American Social Science, 1865–1905 (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1975); Thomas L. Haskell, The Emergence of Professional Social Science: The American Social Science Association and the Nineteenth-Century Crisis of Authority (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1977); Ellen Herman, The Romance of American Psychology: Political Culture in the Age of Experts (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995); Dorothy Ross, The Origins of American Social Science (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991); and Mark C. Smith, Social Science in the Crucible: The American Debate over Objectivity and Purpose, 1918–1941 (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 1994)*


Liberal democracy (pluralist) vs  commust (morally absolutist - driven by ruling elites who forced their values)
* But social science biased → then not na good basis for public action


Historian robert proctor: neutrality nad objectivity are not the same thing. Neutrality = whether science takes a stand. Objectivity = whether science merits claims to reliability

Responded to these problems (relationship b/w knowledge and policy) with diff positions:
1. DeLong “quintessential”: stark separation of scholar vs policymaker; knowledge producer and knowledge user

2. Mintz: produce rigorous knowledge directed only toward ends the researcher deemed ethical

3. Sociologist Boguslaw: reject boundary b/w science and action . scientific knowledge inherently political

	1. Expert is scholar of “radical social action”

		1.  [. Robert Boguslaw, “Social Action and Social Change,” in Handbook on the Study of Social Problems , ed. Erwin O. Smigel (Chicago: Rand McNally, 1971), 423. ](https://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1131&context=jssw&httpsredir=1&referer=) 

			1. “social movements, crisis, conflict, resistance to change, and legitimacy.”

				1. Social change theory

		*2.* *Parallels to my perspective…. How was this received?*

		*3.* Social science name has ambivalence. Normative since origins lie in moral commitments to socia welfare, reform and progress

1940s: “faith in ability of selfless scientific experts tot provide objective analysis”  Quoted ibid., 48, 47, 27. See also Bannister, Sociology and Scientism ; and Ross, Origins of American Social Science , 390–470.
* Where did this faith arise from?

* This faith persists now


SORO produced propaganda
* Smith: principles of academic tradition: disinterested pursuit of knowledge, objective, universalist

	* Manipulation was in delongs view a study of “the process of human communication”

	* *It is the use which should be judged by the moral imperatives, not the study of a social process which may be used*

		*  15. DeLong, “Who Are the Career Executives?” 108; *Proctor, Value-Free Science?*

* Axioms: scientific truth is neutral and amoral; political system that grounds its policies on scieitnfici knowledge is inherently ethical

	* In context of cold war, national security == freedom

		* /How does this change in individual data context?/


Defining democracy as a process rather than a goal

End of ideology, consensus on primary goals of public life

Mintz: anti-imperalist/anti colonial
	Handwritten notes/letters
		Emails??

How did these ideas get carried into the future?

Boguslaw: specialized institution for mass violence. But defaeted totalitarians!

*36. Robert Boguslaw, “Ethics and the Social Scientist,” in The Rise and Fall of Project Camelot: Studies in the Relationship between Social Science and Practical Politics , ed. Irving Louis Horowitz (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1967), 107–8, 109. 37. Robert Boguslaw, The New Utopians: A Study of System Design and Social Change (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1965), 47–49. S*

Joined institutions to democratize them. Charles beard, John Dewey, RObert lynd - men who argued for application of relevant empirical knowledge to public life

The scholar who thought he had removed the taint of values from his work simply reproduced the status quo
* Same argument as algorithms of oppression

* Alvin W. Gouldner, Irving L. Horowitz, and C. Wright Mills all had this perspective

Readings on objectivity science*. On the intellectual traditions of Beard, Dewey, and Lynd see Alice O’Connor, Social Science for What? Philanthropy and the Social Question in a World Turned Rightside Up (New York: Russell Sage Foundation, 2007), 59–65; and Smith, Social Science in the Crucible ; Alvin W. Gouldner, “Anti-Minotaur: The Myth of a Value-Free Sociology,” Social Problems 9 (1962): 199–213; Irving L. Horowitz, “Social Science Objectivity and Value Neutrality: Historical Problems and Projections,” Diogenes 39 (1962): 17–44; C. Wright Mills, The Sociological Imagination (New York: Oxford University Press 1959); Boguslaw, “Ethics and the Social Scientist,” 126, 115*
* *It is the use which should be judged by the moral imperatives, not the study of a social process which may be used*

	*  15. DeLong, “Who Are the Career Executives?” 108; *Proctor, Value-Free Science?*

* Expansion of elite bureaucratic and technological control over the thoughts, actions, values of everyone

* The shape of power is becoming more and more obscure

	* Want to keep power relations in plain view

	* Found root cause of cleavage of fact and value not on political circumstances but in social scientific hyperprofessionalism

		* Demand of unbias → shy away from controversy, which loses funding

		* Condenming bias == never engage in a study which deals with non trivial aspects of social and political life Boguslaw, “Social Action and Social Change,” 433; Boguslaw, “Ethics and the Social Scientist,” 111, 125.

* Existentialism lol 

* Masked central role of militarization: miliarization shaped his sense of agency

	* Even dissenting intellectuals could be blind to its ubiquity

	* (speaking from within the complex)


Common ground of all 3:
* Scientific study of social phenomena was path to truth

* Using science leads to social and political progress


Herman kahn: framed nuclear holocaust “in the bloodness disalect of rpobabilistiic risk assesment”

Revolution comes from marginalized ppl suffering from anomie
→ opposite?

/What is the status quo rn/
/Justified using the guise of democracy./
/Here, justified under → recommendations make things more convenient! Faster! Improvfes life fro everyone!/

### Ch 3 project camelot
* Scholars allied with the pentagon; controversy caused them to fear that the State Department would derail their research. → enhanced militiarization of social sicence and foreign policy
