# acting masculinely

Women were found to actively perform masculinity, attempting to fit in with their male
colleagues by showing that they did not require special treatment and by sharing
their camaraderie:
I give them as good as I get. So it‟s equal. And you have a laugh. If you give
them respect, they‟ll give you respect back (Suzanne, Engineering
Environmental Technology student).
This is similar to what Sheppard (1989: 146) described as a strategy of “blending in
and claiming a rightful place”. Sheppard found that „blending‟ depended on the
management of being both feminine enough, in terms of appearance, selfpresentation and acceptance of expectations, and business-like enough, in order to
claim a place in the organisation. Moreover, Knights and Kerfoot (2004), for
example, found that „career-women‟ demonstrate “that masculinity is not the
exclusive preserve of men. [Women] apparently see no alternative other than to
emulate men in order not to be compared negatively with them or to suffer from the
stereotypes that masculine hegemonic organisations reproduce” (2004: 447).
Schmitt et al. (2003) also argue that conforming to organisational norms and
displaying masculine behaviour may be necessary to avoid stereotypical
performance expectations based on one‟s sex. However, this strategy can also
backfire, as women who conform to masculine work roles may be penalised for not
being „womanly enough.‟
