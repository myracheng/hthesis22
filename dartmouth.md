# Dartmouth workshop
#1950s


- [Dartmouth workshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop) funded by Rockefeller foundation, co-founded by Shannon @ Bell Labs
> In early 1955, McCarthy approached the Rockefeller Foundation to request funding for a summer seminar at Dartmouth for about 10 participants. In June, he and Claude Shannon, a founder of information theory then at Bell Labs, met with Robert Morison, Director of Biological and Medical Research to discuss the idea and possible funding, though Morison was unsure whether money would be made available for such a visionary project.[6]

    - why does Rockefeller care about artificial intelligence?
        QQ i want to read how they got the funds!! the porposal to rockefeller

    - also IBM: Rochester
    - chess machines, math machines, modeling human behavior in [original proposal](http://raysolomonoff.com/dartmouth/boxa/dart564props.pdf)

- co-editing an Annals of Mathematics Study on \The Theory of Automata"

The significance of this new field, while murky to outsiders, was immediately evident to practitioners. IBM, Bell Laboratories, and RAND all lent support for their key researchers to attend.
    - MC why why why  !!

"collaboration"
- Dartmouth conference signaled a major paradigm shift in how mathematical work would happen in the computer age. Essential to the conference was bringing researchers with disparate specialties together, freeing them from the strictures of teaching and publishing within their own subfields, and offering time and opportunity for collaboration and exchange of ideas and information.

- The Dartmouth conference proved to be the high water mark of RF funding in the field of computer science. With military and corporate research increasingly driving the computer industry in the coming years, RF funding became less and less necessary. But the seeds the Foundation planted proved to be crucial to many later advances in the field.

### rockefeller documents
- companies interested in it from the very start
> IBM and Lincoln Laborato{·ies wanted t;o send additional participants and were wil ling and able to pay t'or it. (p 42)
    
new yorkers quip abt dartmouth grant?? (p 4x)

the operation of the machine is meant to follow what the atuhor belivees to be how abstract learnign takes place in man p 50

#### an inductive inference machine proposal
the finding of "words" that have a high and useful correlation with other "words" has been the most important task of science (p 51)
    - type 2: set of words that occur together, e.g. "engine' with "automobile"

    -p 94: uses:
    proper training sequences for children
    .... MC lol rly


analysis of the concept of difficulty

AI and machine learning clearly permeate Nokia Bell Labs, and this is no recent development. In March, Bell Labs alumni — and my contemporaries — Yann LeCun and Yoshua Benjio, along with their mentor Geoffrey Hinton, were honored with the ACM A.M. Turing Award, which is often referred to as the “Nobel Prize of Computing.”    LeCun and Bengio worked together at Bell Labs beginning in the early 1990s, laying the foundation for modern-day deep learning.  “Artificial intelligence is now one of the fastest-growing areas in all of science and one of the most talked-about topics in society,” noted ACM President Cherri M. Pancake when the prizes were awarded. 


MC why was IBM and bell labs interested in a workshop that rockefeller was hesitant to fund cuz it seemed too niche/all over the place?
    - bc of shannon?
    -  John McCarthy, a mathematics professor at Dartmouth at the time, had been disappointed that the papers in Automata Studies, which he co-edited with Claude Shannon, did not say more about the possibilities of computers possessing intelligence.
