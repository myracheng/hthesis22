points of reference for a taxonomy of DEI 
in the history of computer science and 


how to use the careers of these individuals to develop a taxonomy

specific history of these conferneces:
- person’s life + how it’s used and talked about later
    - where do those celebratory stories come from, connect the historical person to the ways that those narratives work)
    - (the distinction between the individual, the institutions that make their careers, and the forces that generate/promote narratives)
possibility:
- historical actor who is at war with their own legacy. 

do events carry a legacy

ppl now have a 

the controversy over renaming in cases of "bad actors" vs. the habit of "naming" in cases of heroes.

grace hopper - what she intended vs warping into 

history of CS: modern feminists no longer agree with the old stuff
- the way that someones legacies 
- if it’s bad for the community to use the name of someone we think sucks

using names for any purpose 
—> what is the impact of naming?
- the power of the name: does it empower? holding up a hero vs when they are no longer a hero

grace hopper: how did she become an icon?
- in the academic history of computing literature, there is no grace hopper. and other women do
- she is the only one who is in the military lol
- the creation of the reputation of the grace hopper
2 historiographical universes:
- the actual history
- a subfield of raising up ppl
—> establish that historiographically, the actual history ppl dont have to worry as long as the

** actually ask someone

Like there's a pool of Inspiring Lady Actors' names that private institutions can use to label their own institutions/purposes.

i was going to say assimilation seems like a big topic to explore here


the ways that ppl are depicted in pop culture:
- genius, hard work, etc
- succeeded at a scale that was not built for them.
- 
That reminds me so much of Myra's early study of early AI; really seemed like something that a coven of academics willed into existence.

anti-lily kay impulse, i dont care who these ppl are

There have been four articles which mention Hopper in the IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, and they all look to me from the titles like pretty narrowly technical articles. They’re not, for example, on gender as a social phenomenon which structure professional lives in computing.
