Foucault’s theory of governmentality,

the active production of ‘women in computing’ as a discourse for women serves to
constrain and contain women’s involvement in Computer Science.

Although feminist literature which produces ‘women in computing’ in industry
and academia does serve to counter other stereotypical images of women’s (in)ability in
math, science and engineering, I argue that this active representation of ‘gender interests’
in computing reproduces stereotypical and essentialized knowledge about women’s
epistemology and ontology

 The proliferation of articles on the topic, which are self-

referential within a largely North American academic ‘women in computing’ network,
indicates a disturbing stasis in the field


Summary:
CH 2:
This chapter reviews the positioning of ‘women in computing’ as a
discourse inside technoscience, starting with some examples of disciplinary practices
within the field. I also introduce my theoretical framework, principally Dorothy Smith’s
sociological method of inquiry into institutional ruling relations, and Michel Foucault’s
theories of governmentality and care for the self.

. Using Foucault’s work on governmentality and the ‘technologies of
the self’, I show how neo-liberal discourses of individualism, progress, regulation and
accountability interplay with liberal feminist education policy and practices promoting
‘women in computing’ in the production of individualized, ambitious, self-regulating and
self-accumulating subjects.


his rupture, or line of fault (Smith, 1987, p. 49), reinforced my sense that the
‘problem’ of ‘women in computing’ — that is, how women in computing are
institutionally organized as a ‘problem’ group — was the problemati

x). However, I acknowledge that the
feminist participatory research/participant relationship is still problematic in the
complicated set of interests and power relations that are continually negotiated (Naples,
2003, p. 190). And the product of my research, this writing, is only ever a partial view.
