“Marvin Minsky—commonly known as the father of artificial intelligence”
“the enormous role that 1960s counterculture played in developing the beliefs about the Internet that exist in 2017, the time this book was written. My goal here is to show you how the dreams and goals of specific individuals have shaped scientific knowledge, culture, business rhetoric, and even the legal framework of today’s technology through deliberate choices. ”

 

 

“all these assistants are given female names and default identities by tech executives and developers—no accident. “I think that probably reflects what some men think about women—that they’re not fully human beings,” said social anthropologist Kathleen Richardson, the author of An Anthropology of Robots and AI: Annihilation Anxiety and Machines in a 2015 interview with LiveScience. “What’s necessary about them can be replicated, but when it comes to more sophisticated robots, they have to be male.”

 

“computing pioneer Alan Turing, who, like Minsky, did his graduate work at Princeton. Turing was hopeless at social interaction. Turing’s biographer—Jack Copeland, director of the Turing Archive for the History of Computing—writes that Turing preferred to work in isolation: ”
- MC: alan is the opposite of [[grace]]
    - “He wore shabby clothing, his fingernails were always dirty, and his hair stuck out at wild angles. ”
while turing got away with this, grace was pristine

 
 


“Disciplines like math, engineering, and computer science pardon a whole host of antisocial behaviors because the perpetrators are geniuses. This attitude forms the philosophical basis of technochauvinism, in which efficient code is prioritized above human interactions.”

 

“ human computer was a person, a kind of clerk, who was hired to perform calculations. Human computers were the people who did the math in order to write books of mathematical tables”

 
“Few women had enough mathematical education to perform the necessary calculations; of this small set, even fewer were supported in seeking employment outside the home. In the nineteenth century, most women weren’t allowed to vote in the United States.”

 

“he way that white male bias interacts with the genius myth inside STEM fields is even more pernicious. Even today, women and people of color are rarely considered math or tech geniuses.”
