meritocracy is the greatest fiction of computing

By the 1960s, Britain was gripped by
the idea that success in building and using
computers could save its shrinking empire.

In recent years, historical studies of
women in computing have proliferated,
uncovering women’s contributions and
adding them back into the historical record.

, arbitrary circumstances made
certain women visible while many others
remain hidden.

this article makes the argument that meritocracy has prevented black women from succeeding in CS

my question is, hwo does the hagiographies still presume a CS that is not good.

Apparently, as many people know, the age of the participatory membership organizations is over — their numbers are certainly way down — and we in CPSR had certainly noticed that trend.

Perhaps the most important fi ction in the
history of computing is the concept of
meritocracy. Within the fast moving world
of high technology, sheer talent seems to
trump differences that lead certain people
to ascend to the top while others sink to
the bottom. Computing seems to hold the
promise of the American Dream: a fi eld
where cleverness can trump credentials and
success is dictated by ingenuity and hard
work. Scores of current initiatives aimed
at getting women and minorities into
computing careers turn on the idea that
computing is, at base, a meritocracy

Meritocracy is a worthy
goal, but when merely asserted in the face
of existing power imbalances it does little
good. History shows that every meritocratic system is circumscribed in particular
ways that allow only certain people to
truly compete equally
