# Google’s true origin partly lies in CIA and NSA research grants for mass surveillance

#1990s intelligence community
supercomputing community university -> private sector

CIA, NSA budgets in jeopardy (clinton admin), and private sector had vast resources 
--> to do surveillance, needs to do partnership


creation of internet:
1970's, DARPA -> NSF -> WWW
MC QQ mentioned in john mccarthy??

Massive Digital Data Systems (MDDS) project was funded by CIA and NASA
-  Today, the NSF provides nearly 90% of all federal funding for university-based computer-science research.

“birds of a feather” briefing, and the “Birds of a Feather Session on the Intelligence Community Initiative in Massive Digital Data Systems” took place at the Fairmont Hotel in San Jose in the spring of 1995.

Brin and Pag went to one of these grants
    - basically caused by DARPA - NSF
intelligence efforts - able to track them, mimicking human intelligence

the collaboration between the intelligence community and big, commercial science and tech companies has been wildly successful.

“Not only are activities becoming more complex, but changing demands require that the IC [Intelligence Community] process different types as well as larger volumes of data,” the intelligence community said in its [1993 MDDS white paper](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mail.cypherpunks/4CDiW59hS88). “Consequently, the IC is taking a proactive role in stimulating research in the efficient management of massive databases and ensuring that IC requirements can be incorporated or adapted into commercial products. Because the challenges are not unique to any one agency, the Community Management Staff (CMS) has commissioned a Massive Digital Data Systems [MDDS] Working Group to address the needs and to identify and evaluate possible solutions.”

- In 1995, one of the first and most promising MDDS grants went to a computer-science research team at Stanford University with a decade-long history of working with NSF and DARPA grants. The primary objective of this grant was “query optimization of very complex queries that are described using the ‘query flocks’ approach.” A second grant—the DARPA-NSF grant most closely associated with Google’s origin—was part of a coordinated effort to build a massive digital library using the internet as its backbone. Both grants funded research by two graduate students who were making rapid advances in web-page ranking, as well as tracking (and making sense of) user queries: future Google cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page.

- It was the beginning of what in just a few years’ time would become Google. The two intelligence-community managers charged with leading the program met regularly with Brin as his research progressed, and he was an author on several other research papers that resulted from this MDDS grant before he and Page left to form Google.

secret Pentagon-sponsored group, that for the last two decades has functioned as a bridge between the US government and elites across the business, industry, finance, corporate, and media sectors.

Highlands Forum, secret meeting for high-tech network-based warfare.”
- connected to defense

SAIC, Forum has co-chairs
- Marshall, DoD official
- Richard O'Neill, DoD
- director of DARPA (prev at SAIC)

sponsired by Office of Secret of Defense
- In 1989, Richard O’Neill, then a US Navy cryptologist, wrote a paper for the US Naval War College, ‘Toward a methodology for perception management.’
    -  O’Neill’s paper for the first time outlined a strategy for “perception management” as part of information warfare (IW). 

forum meeting:
- “network-centric warfare” in the minds of “the nation’s top military thinkers.”

ederal advisory committees are already heavily influenced, if not captured, by corporate power. 

Throughout the development of the search engine, Sergey Brin reported regularly and directly to two people who were not Stanford faculty at all: Dr. Bhavani Thuraisingham and Dr. Rick Steinheiser. Both were representatives of a sensitive US intelligence community research programme on information security and data-mining.
    - intelligence community’s MDDS program essentially provided Brin seed-funding, which was supplemented by many other sources, including the private sector.”

ow deeply entrenched the culture of Silicon Valley is in the values of the US intelligence community.

the Intelligence Community [IC] started a program called Massive Digital Data Systems (MDDS)

omg /r/DeGoogle has been purchased by Alphabet Inc. Soon we will provide further announcements in regards to the future of the community. We will be providing a new advanced google search feature, you will be able to link your google account, we will upgrade the community to be protected by ReCaptcha, and much more! Stay Tuned!
