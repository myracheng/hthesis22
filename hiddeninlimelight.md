a radical – and more inclusive – rethinking of innovation.

Mazzucato’s (2015) theory of the entrepreneurial state to understand the role of the state in spurring innovation in different temporal frames, and Fraser’s (1995, 2000) approach to redistribution to enable an understanding of how feminist collective efforts have been displaced by individual achievements

vignettes from Hidden Figures to situate innovation historically

Innovation is entrenched in masculine practices (McIntyre, 2015; Wikhamn
and Knights, 2013); role models for inventors are mainly white men (Alsos et al., 2013; Pettersson,
2007) and women’s contributions are often not perceived as innovative (Danilda and Thorslund,
2011; Lorentzi, 2011),

bell
hook’s concept of the ‘white supremacist capitalist patriarchy’ as it provides a clear theorisation of
the interlocking nature of gender, race and class for understanding oppression.

Crenshaw (1989) uses the term intersectionality to reflect on how different identities might collide and thus cannot be understood by focusing on a single identity category.
The term has also been used to criticise the essentialist nature of dominant liberal white feminist
approaches to understanding the experiences of women, who are often treated as a homogeneous
group (Holvino, 2010)

This dualist thinking is also, for Hooks
(2013a), one explanation of why sexism has thus far been the most important system to challenge
in a way that has been decoupled from other systems of power.

Needless to say, the centring on white privilege is dangerous for several reasons,
such as the risk of whiteness becoming the hegemonic category (Nkomo, 1992) against which all
other groups are defined and evaluated, placing other groups in the margins. Innovation, however,
remains to be interrogated in a political way.

as Liu (2018a)
reminds us, a focus on individual identities and categories of differences underplays the questioning of the reproduction of white, imperialist power

e thus unstitch how gender and race are trapped in
patriarchy and white privilege. From this viewpoint, innovation can no longer be neutral, but turns
into a political exposure of the reproduction of oppressive orders in (predominantly white) imaginaries of the future. 

## mazzucato

In the context of the U.S. in
the 1960s, innovation was configured around a collective praxis where the state played a critical
role through its long-term investments and active participation in creating future markets for technology. Following Mazzucato’s (2013) thesis on the entrepreneurial state, the role of the state at the
time of the space race was to invest in ‘mission-oriented’ policies

With the emergence of a neoliberal society, however, the state downgraded itself from an orchestrator of the future to being on a par with enterprises at large
- The privatisation of the innovation contex

Following Fraser (1995, 2000), we have witnessed, over the past decades, a displacement from
redistributive politics to identity politics. Translated into the context of this paper, the collective
impetus of the innovation context has been displaced towards an individual effort.

This has resulted in an
ambiguous situation for women, as the postfeminist subject who ‘is exhorted to fashion herself as
an independent and ambitious ‘working girl’ who also conforms to traditionally feminine conduct
and desires’ (Liu, 2018b: 2). Postfeminist constructions of the independent, highly feminine woman
in mainly male-dominant workspaces have taken central stage in the current neoliberal era (Lewis,
2014).The idea of a responsible, successful, competitive woman
who can ‘have it all’ (Duffy and Hund, 2015) implies a move away from expectations of welfare,
justice, and equality as a civil right (Fraser, 2013) towards the construction of an entrepreneurial
self. Therefore, women are asked to ‘invent themselves’ in solitude and make use of qualities traditionally constructed as feminine to gain an advantage in the market.

Liberal values,
comprising citizens with civil rights, are supplanted by a neoliberal society of innovative and entrepreneurial actors (Fraser, 2000). Through these displacements, the collective understanding of
innovation and social development is replaced by the individualisation of innovation where social
development merely seems to follow on and structural inequalities are blinded
- MC ?? 

For women, it results in a postfeminist
impasse: they are expected to empower themselves, be innovative and contribute on a par with men
(and thus imitate male ideals). If feminism previously emphasised social change as the answer to
inequality, today women are called to participate in a make-over of themselves to fit the innovation
context.


## important to tell stories
Holvino (2010: 263) suggests that telling the stories of
organisational actors ‘across different axes of power and identity practices is an important intervention for changing dominant organisational discourses’

Faludi (2013), Sandberg’s call for women to lean in is rooted in a logic of individualistic achievement that leaves structural social and economic change untouched.

Women in computer science and programming have been ‘airbrushed out’ (Tassabehji et al., 2020: 4), first by men and then by technologies. During World War
II, women contributed with ground-breaking work in computing (e.g. as coders). Later, they were
progressively replaced by men. Today, the very definition of a computer is of a machine, a term that
Katherine in Act 1 shows used to be related to women’s computational work. Thus, the foundational
role of women in the development of the profession has historically been wiped out (Tassabehji
et al., 2020).


Many achievements of Black women
are underplayed and/or hidden from the public eye, from Grace Murray Hopper, the ‘mother of’
Harvard Mark 1 (computer language) and creator of the first compiler to Valerie Thomas, a Black
woman working at NASA, who in 1980 developed and patented a 3D illusion transmitter that
allows us to enjoy 3D movies today.
