# meeting with natalie bernat 3/18

the way that systems create inequality. the way that systems evolve change the way ppl interact with each other

use computers as case study for building intellient system as impressive as brains

control theory vs social control


- computer science: came in 2011
    - taking classes during 2014 explosion of CNNs
    - FB + NYU relationship <-- rly strong. look into in the future
        incentives for graduate students to work at FB: very material (fellowships)
            advisors have joint positions
        2014 - 2016 had a lot less questioning of this relationship
        FB has so much data, which is important
        every incentive pushes u to work for companies. how can i make my research benefit this company so that i can get all these benefits
    
- neurips : established as interdisciplianry space for ppl trying to understand systems
built with neurons / theoretical models of neurons --> veered off into engineering-heavy, and the neuroscience presence is 1 workshop
 - KAY:  we get obsessed with the tools that we can use to study the systems, to just see what we can do with the tools.
 - study of human beings: narrative-based methods (history) is overshadowed by statistical and data-driven approaches. how caltech students conceive of how they are connected to others


**look at how ai started from neuroscience.**


privileged ppl who ahve ideas about knowledge --> generate fields of expertise that they dont have basic literacy in
    - as grad student, it is the opposite of this: generating new knowledge that requires recognition/home/research base

What are the institutions, stars/ winners/losers?

does anyone care enough to fund me/hire me


aws: idealized freeing of these resources
- could only get that level of access to computation. 
- learning curve to using it, u can
