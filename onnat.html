In every great period in history there is primarily noticeable the kind of thinking which springs from the social conditions of the age and which reacts upon these to alter them -. In comparison with the general problems which occupy the thoughts of men in any particular period the so-called “national ambitions” (to which, moreover, men have to be artificially trained), have scarcely any significance.
