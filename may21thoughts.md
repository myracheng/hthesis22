use the institution

- original work: collecting and stringing together narratives / personal experiences

--> what were national groups and organizational groups
anchored in local history

outside of that, what do u want to connect it to

the class of 1771
- what happened to them
- how did all of these trajectories intersect

- assess the feasibility of talking to non-caltech ppl

as u work on this, where do u want to work theoretically/argumentatively

A History of Grace Hopper
- hordes of ppl who have benefited from it
- useful foil of thinking throuhg our vision of D, E, I
- Grace Hopper approach is tied to earlier understanding of what will produce equity (girlbosses!)

    - can move from it in a lot of different directions

history of marginaluzed groups participating in these thigns is well-troden

relationship between post-1980s rise of the CEO and confluence w silicon valley

Silicon Valley, Women, and the California Dream
Gender, Class, and Opportunity in the Twentieth Century
GLENNA MATTHEWS

Matthews shifts focus in the last part
of the book to better..educated native..born
women who worked in high tech. They largely
conformed to a male culture of work that re..
quired seventy hour work weeks. At the same
time, Matthews referred to the Silicon Valley
in her last chapter as "The Feminist Capital
of the World." She related story after story
of women labor organizers, environmental
activists, politicians, business people, and
workers who continue to shape Silicon Valley
today. "Though such women might not nee..
essarily call themselves feminists, they have
accomplished feminist goals"
