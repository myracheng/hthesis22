# Molecular vision of life

* Ideals of cooperation embedded into everything

* Funded by rockefeller foundation : new version of eugenics with more “scientific basis”

* Framework: cultural hegemony

	* Scientists help reach consensus though they are not actively complicit

* Delbruck: given bc ability to est collaborative rpgroa

* Caltech did not have a bunch of competing disciplinary traditions “open” in  asense

	* Unique institutional structure

		* Formidable alliance with Socal business elite. Situated Clatech squarely within the local political economoy

	* Formation of a consensus on scientific and social goals

* What is life? What is intelligence?

	* AGI

* Science whose form and content fit with the wider, dominating patterns of knowing and doing. Optimal match between visions of human engineering and representations of life grounded in technological intervention. Resonance between scientific imagination and socia lvision

CUltural hegemony: the original concepts of cultural hegemony and the role of intellectuals in society were formulated by Antonio Gramsci, /Selection from the Prison Notebooks/(1929-1935), Q. Hoare and G. N. Smith, eds. and trans. (New York: International Publishers, 1971). For an elaboration of the Gramscian framework and its usage in American history see T. J. Jackson Lears, “The Concept of Cultural Hegemony: Problems and Possibilities,” /American Historical Review, 90/(1985), pp. 567-393, and six papers on the scope and limits of Gramscian hegemony, “A Round Table: Labor, Historical Pessimism, and Hegemony,” /Journal of American History, 75/(1988), pp. 115-162. 
				
			
## Ch 1

* Science is symbol of reason and efficiency

* American exceptionalism = accommodation to industrial capitalism [7]

* “Softer” notion of social control

	* || discrimination based on diff attributes

	* Social control as a system of knowledge

## Ch 2 

## Ch 3
- Caltech's triumvirate, science aristocracy "nordic roots", social privilege, and profesional visions (from biography of morgan)

|| mission: for biology an independent disciplianry identity

Terman [[leslie]] was in HBF

- motivated strongly by fiscal concerns
"millions of dollars secured for research" (in letter from moyes) (88)
- "pure" science vs palliative work represented by hospital activities
	- but not actually pure... or maybe literally pure... "perpeutation of the progress of the race" (87)

Morgan himself did little chemistry

discrepancy between intent and practice a conflict of loyalties

physics/chem at apex of comtean ladder. little rspect for biologists, who are unrigorous
- ML in same role?
- inihbiiting collaborations between these constitutencies at caltech
	- from morgan papers

Hixon Fund was established at the Institute to support research on human behavior.


## interlude 1

- describing diff perspectives/paradigms
- protein paradigm vs classical genetics
- all these guys got swept under the mol bio name

- world of negleted dimensions || dimensions (high)

- "UC boys" use novel tools that other ppl dont understand ||
- "quantiative theories demonstrated nothing more than the hyponotic power of numerology" (115)
- attempting to uncover mechanisms


## approaches (mtg 2)
- instrumententation: ultra centrifuge totally reframes how ppl r thinking about stuff 
- biography

## ch 5
- cooperation model after corporations
- this book makes me feel dumb
rockefeller gift to caltech was aimed at the biological improvemnet of the race 156

## ch6 
immunology
war
providided continuity, prestige, and resoruces
"complex web of corporate science"
strengthen caltechs position. war projects coordinated between government univerisites nad companies [22]

war is good for interdisciplinarity :*
