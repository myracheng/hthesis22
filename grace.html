Her group also included the soon-to-be famous mathematician John von Neumann, and together they laid down some of the fundamental principles of computation. (Some historians actually argue that von Neumann took credit for Hopper’s ideas at the time.) <a href="https://nymag.com/vindicated/2016/11/the-most-important-female-coder-youve-never-heard-of.html">https://nymag.com/vindicated/2016/11/the-most-important-female-coder-youve-never-heard-of.html</a></p><p>Did the programming world fall over itself to hail Grace Hopper for her brilliant revolution? No. Quite the opposite, in fact. The head of computer operations at General Electric, Herb Grosch, led a vocal resistance movement for more than a decade. They argued that programming was far too delicate and ingenious an activity for any part of it to be left to the computer itself. It was clear to Hopper that programmers regarded themselves as “high priests,” jealously guarding their status as intermediaries between ordinary people and the occult computer brain. They felt that her compiler was a threat to their status. “Well, you see,” she said later, “someone learns a skill and works hard to learn that skill, and then if you come along and say, ‘You don’t need that, here’s something else that’s better,’ they are going to be quite indignant.”</p><p>Hopper spent a decade writing papers and giving conference talks while the computing priesthood tried to smack her down, but the tide only really began to turn when she appealed directly to business executives, the potential users of her product. To them she promised greater speed, efficiency, and ease. One of her early compilers was called “Business Language version 0,” which reflected her idea that programming could be made transparent and simple enough for office workers to understand. Her strategy finally worked. By the end of the decade, payroll and inventory applications were being written at various military departments and industrial corporations with Hopper’s own language, FLOW-MATIC — a system that hardcore programmers still mocked because it was too easy for ordinary people to understand.</p><p>nother source of resistance to Grace Hopper’s innovations is still all too recognizable today — sexism. In 1960, Hopper participated, along with several other female computing pioneers, in the development of the computing language COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language). The majority of the elite computing “priesthood” predicted its rapid demise. According to one historian of technology, many of the skeptics had “concluded that the fruits of such an unstructured, female-dominated process could not be expected to survive, let alone flourish.” (By the year 2000, notwithstanding such prophecies, it was estimated that COBOL constituted about 240 billion out of the 300 billion lines of computer code in the whole world.) Yet things improved rapidly, in part thanks to Hopper’s own example. By 1968, according to an article in Cosmopolitan titled “The Computer Girls,” there were more than 20,000 women programmers working in the U.S., and there was demand for as many more: In this field, it said, sex discrimination was rare, and a woman could be “fully accepted as a professional.”</p><hr /><p><a href="https://news.wjct.org/post/grace-hopper-queen-code-would-have-hated-title">https://news.wjct.org/post/grace-hopper-queen-code-would-have-hated-title</a> Grace Hopper was able to succeed in a number of male-dominated institutions: the Navy, the computing industry. And yet she never considered herself a feminist. I have a clip in my documentary where she’s asked by an interviewer, “What have you made of the women’s [liberation] movement of the last 20 years?” And she said: “I don’t know much about it ’cause I didn’t have to worry about it. I was in the Navy.”</p><p>GRACE HOPPER: Well, it had to be the Navy because my great-grandfather was a rear admiral, besides which I like blue.</p><p><a href="https://libguides.umn.edu/c.php?g=1081248">https://libguides.umn.edu/c.php?g=1081248</a> &lt;– Archives and Special Collections on Women in Computing</p><p><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/26296392">https://www.jstor.org/stable/26296392</a> “Remembering Grace Hopper”</p><ul><li>she was extremely put together, contrast to biographies of other CS heroes <span class="zettel-link-container cf"><span class="zettel-link"><a href="artificialunint">artificial unintelligence</a></span></span></li></ul><p>Janet Abbate’s review of Breyer’s biography: (file:///Users/m/Downloads/abbate2010.pdf, <a href="https://sci-hub.do/https://doi.org/10.1007/s11016-010-9418-z">https://sci-hub.do/https://doi.org/10.1007/s11016-010-9418-z</a>)</p><ul><li>The historiography of computing has more than its share of ‘‘great man’’ accounts lionizing inventors and business leaders.
