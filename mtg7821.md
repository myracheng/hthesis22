- historiographical work
    scrutizining how ppl r telling history

characterizing: when we tell the history of cs, information, data, co73k_ai
in the 80s
pre-1990s, post-cold war
in north america
- which historians focus on which actors

canonical history: all dudes, all the time
elevating history: 

1) lay that out^
summarize and write
puts words on the page

a history of the making of grace hopper
- strategically pick different eras
    - grace hopper as a brand, grace hopper's legacy
- when the conference was established
- think about a good time before 
    when was she awarded something, hired somewhere
     1964: Hopper was awarded the Society of Women Engineers Achievement Award, the Society's highest honor, "In recognition of her significant contributions to the burgeoning computer industry as an engineering manager and originator of automatic programming systems."[48] In May 1955, Hopper was one of the founding members of the Society of Women Engineers[49]
from distinct entities: military, corporate, etc

there is something distinct about the way that she is reprsented at these different points, that we can combine 
certain elements that made her famous then, not famous now

it's not my job to make this history good
- evolution of hagiographical portrayals
    - ask: who else was there, who is being ignored?
    - when do ppl go from being ignored to not being ignored
        find ppl who have actively worked against clean/saccharine diversity mission

grace hopper: single, or backbone of comparisons
- when you're looking for ppl to compare to
    - what time are they, on what grounds are they comparable

gaslighted: we're being told that we're being included in history, but it's a history that doesnt have to count for everyone, and a history to appease us
- industry is lying about how much power women have been given
- or history

cant have both: women excluded from central history and be important for the industry

em: model minority --> actually victims of a system
- process that's analogous, situated in other subjects/fields

danielle:
dissertation on accomodationist, reformist, centrist politics after the civil rights era
once black politicans are elected, 
radical agitation to being a part of the establishment was a shift that created a lot of limits and lost opportunities. rise of discourse about black excellence

critical/analytical perspective, related to policy/govt/history: there is no penalty for not going straight from undergrad to grad school
having connections to ppl in well-situated, different communities
