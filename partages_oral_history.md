# Oral History with Hopper

- Betty Holberton:
-  We don’t hear about everybody, don’t hear about Betty Holberton. She did combine the two, she has two charming daughters and made tremendous contributions to the industry. Pantages: She’s retired now isn’t she? Hopper: Yes, I don’t think she’s ever been properly appreciated. You might do a piece on her some day, with all her contributions. They’ve never been fully recognized as I was. She wasn’t as articulate as I was and she didn’t stick her neck out as far. She made tremendous contributions right from C-10 code on.

Hopper: I wanted to be an engineer, but there was no place for women in engineering
when I graduated. (in 1928)

Hopper: And he started hiring bright
young women. I’d say close to half of the people that worked on all the beginning work on
programming and the non-hardware side of ENIAC were women. And his right hand assistant in
building the C-10 code was Betty Holberton. And he encouraged her to write that first
sort/merge generator, which was the first time anybody used the computer to write a program.
And part of it was necessity. The young men weren’t available. And the bright young women
were. 



**A gal who was a good secretary was bound to become a programmer, meticulous, careful about getting things right.** Step-by-step attitude. The things that made them good secretaries were the very things that made them good programmers. Plus I think that it’s always been true that women were more willing to finish the job. They’ll stay with it; tie up all the loose ends. If they make a dress they put the snappers and button holes in. Whereas men, once they’ve solved the problem to their satisfaction, want to go on to the next problem instead of tying up all the loose ends. So you usually get better documentation from women. You can’t make that the final generalization, but I think it’s pretty much true. They are more willing to complete it and tie it up in a neat little bow at the end. Then I always said that the concept of getting the data all together so you could operate on it was the **same thing as getting a dinner ready. You had to get all the parts together and have it finished at one time.**

Now there is one handicap on women, is that
they want everything. They are going to have some choices, they can’t have everything. And
women’s lib is trying to encourage them that we can have everything

women: In the computer industry, they are way ahead of
any other industry. I think they will go further as time goes on, not by women’s lib, **not by annoying everybody.** But by doing a better job
