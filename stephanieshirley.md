Having experienced sexism in her workplace, "being fondled, being pushed against the wall",[10] she wanted to create job opportunities for women with dependents, and predominantly employed women, with only three male programmers in the first 300 staff,[11] until the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 made that practice illegal. She also adopted the name "Steve" to help her in the male-dominated business world,[12][10] given that company letters signed using her real name were not responded to.[13] Her team's projects included programming Concorde's black box flight recorder

 In other words, the company had a woman boss. The ad also announced that there were “opportunities for retired programmers (female) to work from home.” In 1964, this was revolutionary.


 how military funding excludes women. 

  Shirley also knew that British industry and government were getting rid of most of the people who had programming skills and training because they were women, thereby starving the entire country of the critical labour that it needed to modernise effectively.

  By utilising just a small portion of this wasted talent, Shirley rescued many women’s skills from being discarded entirely and helped British industry and government fulfil some of the promise of computerisation. But for every woman Shirley employed there were always several more applicants she could not. The massive waste of human talent rippled upward, eventually destroying the British lead in computing and the British computer industry.

   People who were not seen as worthy of wielding power were deliberately excluded, even when they had the required technical skills. To a great extent, that process continues today. Now, as then, hierarchies are constructed through high tech to preserve powerful social and political structures.

“Women’s paths in computing were not simply a matter of individual choice but rather relied on constraints engineered into the fabric of their lives by the institutions that employed them. Women like Shirley and Gillespie, though admirably successful, were exceptions that proved the rule rather than examples of how women as a group might succeed in the field in numbers equal to men. Shirley’s business in fact leveraged women’s marginalization in order to succeed, and Gillespie’s career path was one that many women could not adopt.”
