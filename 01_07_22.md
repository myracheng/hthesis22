Thinking about approaches and their limitations
How they (the open source ppl, TANG) frame what the problem and what the solution is
Use those explicit constructions of the problem to compare them to one another
Open source vs citizen science (involving nonscientists, like birdwatchers, inaturalist)
Contrast to : datasets using mturk, FB outsourcing violent posts/toxic posts
The theory powering them: lets use PPL to cover the gap
One is empowering and the other is predatory
Does audrey tang have a different approach (e.g. has explicit goal) or do we like them because they are cool nonbinary etc?

Open source, audrey tang, citizen science, how are these ppl claiming to further the cause and what is the cause
Grace Hopper: the cause: technology! Science! 
Go back to hopper and ask what the through line is.
Second term:
Capacious notes on the literature
Final iteration of RQ
Literature review
Collecting all of the source material
Healthy collection of things to quote, phenomenon to talk about
Solid understanding of second literature


Go back and ask, Grace Hopper and Grace Hopepr’s proponents what aspects of this were they thinking about and what’s useful in the hopper material
