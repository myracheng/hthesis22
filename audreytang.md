Tang has identified as "post-gender" and accepts "whatever pronoun people want to describe me with online."
-  trust and radical transparency, empathy
-  democratising power offered through the connectivity of the Internet and the evolution of democracy in her country
-   only through peer-to-peer relationships can real trust develop. 
-   I mostly oversee a refocus on service design, a refocus on what we call “human experience”can improve the experience of people interacting with government—be it to enjoy their services or provide ideas, create petitions, and so on. 

 When I was 12, I started working with people building the early internet that was before the World Wide Web. When I was 15 or so, I dropped out of high school to work fulltime on World Wide Web and its technologies

  - Sunflower movement, a sudden three-week stand-off in 2014 between the government and Taiwanese protesters occupying parliament over a trade bill purporting to bring their country closer to China.
  - government officials arrived at a bustling lecture theatre on a university campus to ask for the help of a group that few knew even existed: the civic hackers.
    - MC why did they do this?
  - believed in radical transparency, in throwing opaque processes open to the light, and in the idea that everyone who is affected by a decision should have a say in it.
    - MC but is everyone actually able to give an oppinion? / feels comfortable to do so?
  - vTaiwan. (The “v” stands for virtual.) A mixed-reality, scaled listening exercise, it was an entirely new way to make decisions. The platform invites citizens into an online space for debate that politicians listen to and take into account when casting their votes.
    - opposite of social media that generates strife
      - gamify consensus to show commonality rather than difference
  
  - Polis used in Kentucky for a town hall
    - Imel worked with Sam Ford, a Knight News Innovation Fellow at Columbia University who lives in Bowling Green, to come up with the civic assembly concept. https://www.bgdailynews.com/news/first-ever-civic-assembly-gives-residents-chance-to-be-heard/article_0a17254e-a8bb-5f4f-884f-9d0617ab9c08.html

- civic tech, or the usage of technology systems to improve government responsiveness and civic engagement, can be traced to the 1990s with the emergence of “digital democracy.” This was also the period when open-source activists became increasingly connected online. Some of those who would become earlier prominent figures in the g0v community, such as digital minister Audrey Tang, got their start in open-source activism at this time

In the aftermath, the Ma government invited Sunflower activists to create a platform through which it might better communicate with Taiwan’s youth. A Taiwanese civic tech community known as g0v (pronounced “Gov Zero”), which had played a leading role in the Sunflower protests, built vTaiwan in 2015 and still runs it.
