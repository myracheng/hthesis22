reproduce this
    - interview my mom
give the person a rationale for your project
- what youre doing and why, the role of the oral histories in illuminating aspects taht cant otherwise be elucidated
* set series of question
* delve into stuff beyond that

* ask telle about the triad of military, industry, academia

make some sort of survey: long term trends

trial oral history:
- current grad student or undergrad student
- read through some of the oral histories

contact caltech alumni association:

archival research
thesis prize submission deadline
- dont allow yourself to be overwhelemd 
    - six well-chosen subjects
        - no need to go looking for 12

usually 1 or 3: case study of a thing
2s: explicit comparisons

start with a handful of caltech subjects. see if that will work

protocols around confidentiality:
- i am going to record this, if there are parts u dont want me to use, i'm happy to delete those
    - and transcript

- encourage ppl to say "i dont want this to be available for some period of time"

- while that person is still alive

building comfort w/ intervieweee: *giving control over result*

dont give ppl control over content of my thesis

- review response 

bring a sensitive topic up early

"If you choose to do so, it is an option to deposit this in the Caltech Archives"

draft of a letter

come in with notes toward questions, dont read verbatim off the page
-range of questions

heidi:
- started in the 1980's
    - CS was a "curiosity"
    - engineering mentality, ppl were not enthusiastic about CS as a discipline
        - geoffrey fox
        chuck seitz
    - breakdown of ppl, 90s: semi-conscious decision to reconstitute the department (and that's when CNS started)

attendees of the 1994 grace hopper
caltech women graduate students


inclusion of women in a profession
- ideological agenda of some ppl: position feminism as part of a broader egalitarian movement
- grace hoper: military context
    - military: internally, it is an egalitarian thing. but externally an agent of US empire & international un-egalitarian
    - inherently politicized position: overwhelmingly male position, becoming more male

connections between egalitarianism and inclusion

when a field is forming/in flux, opportunities 
-> women get pushed out as engineering gets codified

programming

Programmed Inequality
computing: clerical work
--> once power
UK doesnt have computing industry

labor shortage: always been an issue

just narratives or statistics?

2 cases:
ask everyone the same questions
contact subject if theyre willing to be interviewed --> research background --> then do the oral history
    - types of info to initially gather about: anything they've written, a copy of their CV
    - spend time preparing
- vulnerabiltiy? 

1:1 zoom session

a lot of key ppl left CS in the 80's and 90s
