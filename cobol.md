 COBOL went on to be the most ubiquitous business language to date

Grace hopper being credited for COBOL:
1954: Eckert–Mauchly chose Hopper to lead their department for automatic programming, and she led the release of some of the first compiled languages like FLOW-MATIC. 

1959: she participated in the CODASYL consortium, which consulted Hopper to guide them in creating a machine-independent programming language.

"the grandmother of cobol"

Hopper is sometimes referred to as "the mother of COBOL" or "the grandmother of COBOL",[34][35][36] although Jean Sammet, a lead designer of COBOL, stated that Hopper "was not the mother, creator or developer of Cobol".[37][1]

Plenty of companies still use COBOL, including IBM, UPS, and Cigna. Mario Ceballos, a software engineer at Cigna, told me, “The syntax is kept simple to allow non-programmers (“The Business”) to read it and understand it. COBOL is meant to be explicit, because there shouldn’t be room for assumptions.”

Of course, it has had its critics. In 1975, Edsgar Dijkstra famously proclaimed that “The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should, therefore, be regarded as a criminal offence[sic].” This undoubtedly led to the decline of teaching COBOL in universities, but it remained the dominant business language.

if you look "CObol" up on google, it is very negative sentiment, ex the knowledge panel asks "why is cobol hated"

"When people mention COBOL, it's usually either met with a snort or groan. I don't know much about COBOL, but I've seen some programs written in it. I can see that it's wordy, and to uninitiated eyes such as mine, unintelligible. But, really, aren't all programming languages complete gibberish to a lay person?" https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/112911/why-the-scorn-for-cobol

Was COBOL the first programming language used in financial, stock and banking systems?

Well known languages that co-existed with early COBOL are Fortran and Lisp. These languages were not much used much outside of research and university facilities.

The landscape was highly fragmented within the world of business computing. A number of proprietary low-to-medium level languages existed but generally only ran on one vendors machine. A few examples were: FLO-MATIC, AIMACO and COMTRAN, all of which heavily influenced the development of COBOL.

From this chaos emerged a strong desire to have a machine independent and common language for developing business applications.

According to Jean E. Sammet (The Early History of COBOL), the *US Department of Defense spearheaded and funded the early development of COBOL.*




Breyer:
“Although some widely distributed publications (including the New York Times and the Washington Post2) have listed Hopper as COBOL’s inventor, the development of the popular business language is a far more complex story, involving a number of individuals and organizations.”

“riticisms of COBOL were aimed at the very process of its technical invention, a process that mirrored Hopper’s own style of distributed innovation. Many did not feel comfortable with the prospect of “innovation by committee,” including some who were part of that process. As Howard Bromberg stated, “little control was exercised over the development effort and the degree of guidance normally expected from a group of top-level technical managers was not forthcoming.” The COBOL process of invention did not correlate well with preconceived notions of invention.”

“Instead, “the COBOL committee was plagued by discontinuity of personnel and more often than not by a lack of talent.”50 Howard Bromberg’s comment concerning talent is particularly troubling, in view of the fact that committee members such as Betty Holberton, Jean Sammet, Mary Hawes, and Nora Taylor were the most experienced programmers in the business.”

“some COBOL skeptics concluded that the fruits of such an unstructured, female-dominated process could not be expected to survive, let alone flourish.”

“COBOL’s long-term success was far from inevitable and rested on a combination of interrelated factors. The most obvious were specific actions by Charles Phillips, chairman of the CODASYL committee. In effect, Phillips used the economic weight of the Department of Defense to put pressure on uncooperative companies”

“his request was given financial gravity when Phillips required all future DOD computer procurements to be bundled with a working COBOL compiler.
In view of the purchasing power of the Department of Defense in the early 1960s, even the largest manufacturers were forced to fulfill the DOD’s requirement.52 This did not mean, however, that IBM put other initiatives on hold. Shortly after Phillips’s DOD policy announcement, a senior IBM executive wrote to inform Phillips that IBM intended to complete COBOL processors for its line of computers by the third quarter of 1961. He also mentioned that IBM’s customers were still interested in using COMTRAN, and that IBM had distributed Commercial Translator manuals 3 months earlier.”

“ During the 1950s an elite of mathematics-oriented programmers dominated the field, but with the exponential spread of computers during the 1960s others gained access to computers. The new users, less interested in the “art” of programming, just wanted to solve data-processing problems. They were the first generation of programmers who knew little about the workings of computer hardware and who therefore appreciated a computer language that served as an intermediary between them and the machine.

“Despite Betty Holberton’s accolades for the technology itself , she and others continually acknowledged Grace Hopper as the person most responsible for the success of COBOL during the 1960s.”

“Her position as director of automated programming at the number-two computer manufacturer conferred on her influence over senior management within Sperry Rand and over other senior computer executives.

“ithin the world of computers, Hopper was a connector, a role that few people were capable of playing during the 1960s. Malcolm Gladwell, a science writer for the Washington Post and The New Yorker, eloquently describes the importance of “connectors” in technological revolutions in his 2002 book The Tipping Point. ”
