- Computers at the time could solve very specific mathematical problems, but not much else. Solomonoff wanted to pursue a bigger question, how to make machines more generally intelligent
- "From his earliest years he was motivated by the pure joy of mathematical discovery and by the desire to explore where no one had gone before" <- wrong cite...
