# Nationalism and Culture
ch 1

Science concerns itself exclusively with the
phenomena which are displayed in the great frame which we call Nature, which are consequently
limited by space and time and amenable to the calculations of human though" (18)

science deals only with strict facts" (19)

social science - "the idea that the events of human social life were subject to the
same iron necessity and could consequently be calculated and explained by scientific methods."

in social events it is always a matter of a causality of human
aims and ends, in nature always of a causality of physical necessity. T

"However fully man may recognise cosmic laws he will never be able to change them, because
they are not his work. But every form of his social existence, every social institution which the
past has bestowed on him as a legacy from remote ancestors, is the work of men and can be
changed by human will and action or made to serve new ends."
"Whoever believes in the necessary sequence of all historical events sacrifices the future to the past" <- this is uplifting - we can change the direction of things?

"The causes which underlie the processes of social life have
nothing in common with the laws of physical and mechanical natural events, for they are purely
the results of human purpose, which is not explicable by scientific methods."

everything is motivated by power 
- "When Alexander planned his wars, lust for power played a far more important part than economic necessity."
- The will to power which always emanates from individuals or from small minorities in society is in fact a most important driving force in history.
not money/economic reasons
- "Even the conquest of America by the Spaniards, which depopulated the Iberian Peninsula and lured millions of men away into the new world, cannot be explained exclusively by “the thirst for gold"
    - bourgeoisie, for instance, has in all countries where it achieved social importance, frequently supported movements which were by no means determined by its economic interests, but often stood in open opposition to them. Its fight against the church, its endeavours for the establishment of lasting peace among the nations, its liberal and democratic views regarding the nature of government
    - for they have everywhere yielded up long-won rights and liberties without a struggle and have in this manner aided the advance of fascism in Europe, even though against their will.

MC is google about power? university/research about power?

26:
socialism falls to fascism, eeven as capitalism dies

Will it be a road to freedom, or will it result merely in an improved form of slavery which,
while it secures for man a meagre living, will rob him of all independence of action? 

In every prison, in every barrack there is a certain equality
of social condition. Everyone has the same food, the same clothes, renders the same service,
or performs the same task; but who would affirm that such a condition presents an end worth
working for?

difference : It makes a difference whether the members of a social organization are masters of their fate,
control their own affairs and have the inalienable right to participate in the administration of
their communal interests, or are but the instruments of an external will over which they possess
no influence whatsoever.

MC research is motivated by $, sort of, but its also by the egos of indiv men.

big corporations (30):
- f propaganda, but it is conceived much too narrowly and does not correspond to reality. Even in modern giant capitalism the power-political interests frequently play a larger part than the purely economic considerations, although it is difficult to separate them from each other. Its leaders have learned to know the delightful sensation of power, and adore it with the same passion as did formerly the great conquerors, whether they find themselves in the camp of the enemies of their government, like Hugo Stinnes and his followers in the time of the Germany money crisis, or interfere decisively in the foreign policy of their own country.
- The morbid desire to make millions of men submissive to a definite will and to force whole empires into courses which are useful to the secret purposes of small minorities, is frequently more evident in the typical representatives of modern capitalism than are purely economic considerations or the prospect of greater material profit.
- Every one of its members knows what enormous power the possession of great wealth places in the hands of the 30 individual and the caste to which he belongs.
-  Because of his social position there are left no limits to the power lust of the modern capitalist. He can interfere with inconsiderate egoism in the lives of his fellowmen and play the part of Providence for others.
- The success or failure of monopolistic capitalistic power plans will determine the structure of the social life of the near future.


7. Absolutism — An Obstacle to Economic Development

9. development of science
- We are always dependent upon our predecessors, and for this reason the notion of a “national culture” is misleading and inconsistent

doctrines that fundamentally transform the views of men about the structure of the universe:
 
12. Social Problems of Our Time
- . In every great period in history there is primarily noticeable the kind of thinking which springs from the social conditions of the age and which reacts upon these to alter them
-. In comparison with the general problems which occupy the thoughts of men
in any particular period the so-called “national ambitions” (to which, moreover, men have to
be artificially trained), have scarcely any significance. They only serve to cloud men’s vision of
the real cultural processes and even for a longer or shorter time to hinder these in their natural
development. Only in their inner connections do the historical events of an epoch become understandable to usj

- modern capitalism has during the last two hundred years fundamentally changed all social institutions, and not alone material conditions; it has also given an unmistakable special character to all the intellectual effort of this period

MC draws parallels between money being concentrated in the hands of the few with small states and hitler/fascism siezing power

Men merely tried to “lower the costs of production” by a thorough “rationalization of industry”  ... workers at first believed it—until they felt on their own bodies that they had been deceived and
plunged into still deeper misery. T

- .That the men of science and technology have opened limitless possibilities to production is not disputed by anyone and needs no special proof. But under our present system every achievement of technology becomes a weapon of capitalism against the people and results in the very opposite of that which it was intended to accomplish

- Howard Scott and his 350 scientific collaborators are therefore of the opinion that this imminent catastrophe can only be averted by entrusting the technical men with the direction of industry and radically cutting the hours of work to sixteen per week.

- slave labor /serfdom has never furhtered economy. We need to free labor from the fetters of dependence

- Only by a fundamental reorganization of labor on the basis of fellowship, serving no other purpose than the satisfaction of the needs of all instead of increasing the profits of individuals as today, can the present economic crisis be overcome and the way cleared for a higher social culture.
