danielle: rise and history of discourse of black excellence as an accomodationalist centrist liberalist discourse
approach:
 what are the thigns that are expected of these heroes, and how does this reflect the limitations that are being placed

 nightmare "feminisms"
 - think about 

 youre a harvard professor, what power do you have

 question to ask:
 how do the different sorts of female heros if these eras reflect the patterns/trends of the development of these industries, as they pertain to the place of women and the power of women?

 - how to weave in the social good part? 
    - CPSR is a radical departure/protest politics
        - social good is still within the system

are there examples in the current industry that illustrate/highgliht the differences between approaches?
- radical critique: we shouldnt do war

- accomodationg/working within the constraints of that system

are there female heroes who would be those protest/resistance heros
- tale of two tech feminisms?

what do i want ppl to be able to understand in the current day in a new day because they thought a lot more about how we got here.
how can illuminating the historical dimensions of that problem, help us think about these issues more productively
think about framing the main body of your research question, 
1. what does it mean to be a woman in tech?
2. what does it mean to do good or do better in tech?
black liberation politics: *being who u are* / being someone who is not supposed to belong to a space, will always be a challenge to the space (not the dominant/hegemonic )
    - personal level: individual women
    - technical level: efforts in the industry
1. a dark story?
2. or give ppl new critiera for deciding 
    - use narratives of women to highlight motivations and constraints for future/past movements
(1 is necessary for 2.)

2 is the point of 1, even if it's not explicit in the thesis
- what is the possibility of crating good things in this industry. whe ndoes it work. what can foil efforts t od it.

what are the conditions that act to excldue women
- how do womens responses to those buttress or challenge those conditions?

--> what this means for better/different futures

lots of ppl critiquing sheryl sandberg, but no one is talking about *where it comes from and what does it mean for the future*

black feminist/black liberation:
    - undercommons, etc
    - draw inspiration fro mit

    
# mtg 6/17

topic: a nnarative of a failure to change. 
backgorund: ai/cs/stem has a problem, which is that it has been furthered by, developed by, develoepd in the interests of and inside these halls of power

dominant vlaes
we used to think that computers were smart ppl brain bbs

scholarly/community consensus: this is not the case. 
an intellectual problem, a PR problem, an ethical problem (sexism)

my original research : traditional approaches to representing and diversitifying meet the PR problem, how existing technologies of diversification and neoliberal accoutnability still underpin efforts to make tech ‘good” whic hconstrains the ability of tech to imagine + reinvent the ways that it operates

big background: military corporate
2nd big background: stem gender representaiotn and more recently race represeation

concern about portrarying tech as good for society, falling back on the tools for representation as diversification.

how those efforts produce certain results and negate the possilbiity of producign other results

reaching out to ppl who have experience being diversity
- talk thru how i think thorugh this problem versus how i think about this problem
something that im taking for granted is what ppl have nvr thought about 

claire, katie
undergra dpeers

psosbility of help ppl who r being invited into these spaces, think through the risks and the limits of walking into them

walking into a space that’s not made for you, and then surviving and making menaingful progress

making a prettier picture on top of the machine that exists

why they struggle to make change , where and when to intervene


diversity-friendly projects, older neoliberal approaches to diversity

show what’s new and not new

start reading hagiographies
- hidden figures (they didnt ask to be the darlings of your diversity movement)
- grace hopper
“the cheesier the better”

- what picture is being paitned about the solution to the diversity problem. 
- what tropes persist over time
- are they always talking about the same set of problems
- what are the results?
- why does timnit run into the static that she has, while grace hopper gets to have her conference. whats changingabout women and non-white ppls participations in these schemes, or whats changing about these schemes

find 4-8 examples of diverse ppl, diverse projects
	- at different points in time, different communities. read acorss all of these things and find what are the common strands, 


ppl who r like “i felt like one of the boys”
- totally abosred the values of male white space

diversifying a white, het, male space
- means bringing ppl into that space or replicating that space in other communities
showing ppl several attempts + their outcomes

+ ppl who opt out. feminist groups who are deciding to do tech in other models

possible oral histories:
- placing it into context, makes it very poignant

heart of project:
- the heroes of each generation, we ask them to solve a problem that tehy cant possibly solve. but we are determined to give them credit for stuff
    - martyrs who are “camera ready”
        - in the process of making it ok, are they getting something for it too
give me profiles as if youre developing characters/as a “cast”
- who are they, whats their background, what are their outcomes, how do they connect to others
- we are interested in how these people are used and portrayed. 
    - not interested in who they are and 
start writing the background of the primary PR problem: CS/big data/ai has historically been beholden to corporate and miltiary interests, and now ppl know. 
-	 historigographical: reviwing what ppl are done 

which voice for historical to critical narrative. 

in background context: 
- survey ``tech for good" projects that the largest corporations have embraced.

# mtg 4/29

ethics of controlling that world has been migrated into the world of business
- it's also philosophy and legal
- business school 
1. how do forms of labor become gender, how does gender influence labor
- in STS, feminist history, economic history

2. history of innovation as it relates to the gender balance

TODO think about viability of specific labs
TODO carver mead archives
TODO drop peter a line

TODO look at grace hopper's board
/ claire <- her experience as a woman in science

women in tech/women in AI
- what the messages/missions are
- find these organizations at different periods in time and get a sense of 

timnit would have been seen as success if we looked at it from earlier rubric of gender equality
- corporation using female bipoc labor to take a pass on meaningfully confronting the ways that google perpetuates bigotry

what would a wired magazine from 1990 say about this? where are these conversations happening in the industry, and what is the content of them over time

start off really small scale

- look at a specific lab
ask more fine-grained questions, ask more questions about the culture of that lab
    - doing a close/intimate history of what it's like to be in these sorts of situations
    - collect oral histories
        altering historical record
            making these voices and stories part of the history

longitudinal history : perspective of legacy of lab as its female students become PIs elsewhere
if it's the case that female PIs bring a different set of values than their 
    - then the labs run by women have identifiably different perspectives/values
        - genealogically : look at one person and how the women r approaching things differently
        - mass scale: are there consistent differences/distinctions between female and male

3. what is the experience of being a woman in AI?
[look at everyone at a specific time]
- double labor: being a woman + making a space for other women + being a scientist and have to 
- fairly well documented
- what does it mean on a practical level to be a woman in this field?
    - explicit discussions in VC
- broad experience: here are all sorts of things that women 

convo of public discourse to memory. 
- what it means to be a woman for me rn vs 90s or 70s


study speculative design: look at an artist, project, or batch of projects 
- think about what alternative they illuminate and think about what it highlights about the status quo
- looking for speculative
     added distance, can see what they 
    from old time frame

telling a counter history:
- how to recognize what assumptions are there
    - feminist STS
    - "ocularcentrism" <-- i didnt know what this was
-  want to pick something very narrow
    - e.g. the culture of a specific culture or the path of a specific person/community

project ideas:
- grace hopper:
    - not actually challenging the values (telle whitney advised by carver mead)
    --> current problems with "women in stem" corporate feminism

path dependent nature of institutional development
- denaturalize assumptions 
eelizabeth hinton


developd nations owning things that are unfairly distributed over the globe. legal scholarship: reinvention of idea of jurisdiction. jurisdiction = what court has authorty. no longer a spatial/administrative attribute, but the question of who actually has power on the ground. jurisidiction can belong to someone who is not legally appointed. microsoft rent-to-use. conversation about studying the same problem: person in charge of organizing your shit in day-to-day is the one who has jurisiction. technological and military infrastructure have blended. can i think about what is counted, what is stored as technologies that are shared across these spaces that conflate and combine military or technological approaches. think about why it matters. china as a counter-example. how horrible it is that CCP is using surveillance to surveil ppl. meaningfully ask what is the diff. Google vs CCP. Bitcoin: doing a ton of computing in other places. 

- critical read of a single sort of code
- for the ppl tryin to solve this problem, these r the steps 
historically, lets look at these choices and denaturalize the supposedly natural nature
- recontextualize inside a longer history of surveillance and analysis
- 
not every piece of scholarship has to be polemic
- questions being asked at the cutting edge of the field
- physically and fiscally , how can we imagine it being structured differently
- not political or plemic

power, authority, complicity of the programmer 
- practical, show me that it matters
CC taking a current example and tracing it back

technology/institutional feature that is rooted in military
- taking stock of where it shows up in current technologies
    - e.g. surveillance, GPS, the ways in which this military technology has proliferated. if and how it matters that these thigns have military origins

US vs CHINA: ppl are so quick to presume that china is evil and that there is nothing u can do about google and FB

PUBLIC DISCOURSE TACK:
- the economist reporting about china
    - congressional discussions (political issues)
        - us congressional hearings on the monitoring and imprisonment of uighurs in china
        - amnesty international human rights report on Google and FB
            - the language used is parallel to the ^china
    - open sesame social credit scoring
        - talking heads
            - domestic surveillance
ACADMEIC DISCOURSE TACK:
- presidential addresses, foreign policy journals, what are the people whose opinions matter saying about what we should do about each of these things
- industry focus: what does zucky say about china. 
    - google/china battle. what is google fighting to do, and how is it different from what china has to do? r they both trying to do thing
        - 2009 episode rereading: uniformly portrayed in american media as communist government refusing free internet. 
            - could be reread as 2 parties, both want to control the internet
            - links to free speech favoring/privacy favorign things 
            - thinking of ways that they frame their relationships in contrast to the ways that china is portrayed
        - laws in china
            - probably translated into english
            - thinking about legal interpreattions could be an interesting way
            - interseting way of thinking about the regulatory future of these things
            - chinas decisions of how to establish control over these systems. alternative regulatory frameworks
- weibo theorizing american empire. uniformly held opinion that they were orchestrated by american agents
    - american agents are trying to undermine china. 
- not particularly about google/fb
- irony: the more you know, the less sure you can be that you know anything
    - cambridge analytic, right wing FB angle: ways in which military and surveillance-oriented underpinnings of these technologies are inherently insane. can produce these increasingly odd/out-of-control realities out of data
    - when surveillance drives AI, being seen is more important than being
russian bots, wu mao, etc. when surveillance is the method through which information is generated, all you have to do is surveileld in order to b

the more sources of info exist, and the broader inputs that these analyses rely, the more cooks there ar ein the information ktichen
- ppl didnt ahve more of an idea tof what was going on
- generate these narratives
superproliferation of ways of generating proliferations


historians can change the questions in ppls faces
1. how are these technologies rooted in military
    1. make something that seems like it was immoveable, and make it an option that was taken in history
increasing the number of questions that ppl can ask about what ppl should do and what people can do
- alternative narratives, parallel narratives, creating new routes of inquiry and action

write up the summary of topic for warren by next week
by week 10: (3 mtgs from now)
- make a list of 3 possible topics
ur project is goign to be some node in the web of thoughts that you’re constructing
	- potential spots by maura
	- start thinking about which intersections would be the most 

archives:
- jumping into an abyss and hoping that there is something there
- cant approximate how easy or hard a project is going to be


- read what other ppl are doing and recognize why i dont like it

closed world:
- more straightfoward

make a list of ways in which ppl suggest military involvement matters, sorts of examples that they use, and whether or not that is satisfying
- historiographical framing
- it matters that the military funded AI
    - here's the lens that I use, and you can own all of that work. what do ppl mean, what evidence do they give
    - history powerful: tell a story, tell u what to think based on the story

think about alternatives, what else might AI look like? take advantage of position inside industry
- counterfactuals
    - ai could look like this if it wasn't designed by these people

# mtg 4/1

Q: do we care about normalizing stuff

think about these questions as an insider
conflicts b/w/n rigors of academic standards, vs corporations, vs critique of ppl

philosophical and extra reading
- doing another layer of extra thoughts and questions
- implications of the work 

u can show that rockefeller has these goals, and milikan had these ideas, but how did it ahve an impact on the science that was produced, and if there could have been another science

- where is there an isntance that these connections do matter
    - its not rly a dirty secret, it's more polemical
        just bc it has the origins of something, then it always bears the mark of that thing

- talk to ppl, think through these things
    - when and where and whether does this matter

- focusing on a thing that matters

- socially, institutionally, all these things exist
--> lets look at this specific project and think through how all these things do or dont get done


- the ways that we think and talk about ai fairness are so wacky!
    - how are some of the ways .. predicated on the fact that we're selling things to fairness, consumers who we presume are rational, and have no other traits
    - critique this with more predictable approaches

*THINK about WHEN THIS ACTUALLY MATTERS.*
    - the better arg is not the one that promises to answer everything. but the one that shows that something matters in a demonstrable manner

*CONCRETELY*:
ur doing a history project.
- why does history matter? how can we use it to help ppl to have conversations about just ways to help ? and ways to exist in these spaces.
    - whether and when history matters to the context of what ppl think they sohuld be doing

- here's why every major tech company has a small battalion of woke intellectuals and heres the 3 reasons systemically these projects can only go so far

    - the SS does not exist only to serve the computing
    - within the company : SS 
    more social research driven development
WarGames

the ways that ppl can be used for good
- passive recognition of the fact that it's used for not-good
- what are the ways that ppl think that tech is good. how does this generate correctives. 
    - who started CS for social good? 
        - always a reaction to CS for war. 

revisionist history | orthodox history | constantly cannabalizing one another
- What does CS revisionism look like? who gets to change the narratives and norms and pursuits of the ? what tech is for and whats good and whats bad

whats ethical vs not ethical in data
- has completely shifted
    - by the movement of big data into the corporate and private sphere
    - convos about how much data it was feasible whe nwe're talking about the state vs corporate
surveilalnce in china vs surveillance in US
    - for-profit, so presume that it has no sinister, powerful backing

relationship b/w govt pushing into sphere of development and the active interests 
- collapsed these nuanced ethical qs into -> should the govt do it or sohuld corporations do it? . becomes who should be colelcting the data?
    - it would be much worse if the govt is doing it. at least we're only doing it for profit, at least we r keeping ur name private
        - industry shaped in conversation with government

why AI? why exactly this set of problems? IBM and lincoln lab
- charismatic PIs who are constantly hustling
    - document the rise of a subfield and what it relies upon
    - why do we use this tool for everything
    - help us think through these things

situate class, race, etc inside these spaces
- AI get the most applause at a poetry slam
- AI for humor 
    - it frames our idea of what AI can do. it shapes the way that we think it can do.

what traits are AI doing?

*why is AI all about prediction?*
    - take a rly important problem
    - CV as modern phrenology

propublica recidivism
    - try to trace, before the algorithm, the collection of data that is used to train it, and critically parse out who is collecting this data, for what,

        - heres how to crtiically read a dataset, here r the questions
        - if you want to say tat u didnt make the data, you're just using it. but u have to be able to account for externalities

what data actually are they talking about
    - before corporations were collecting this data, who was?
    - where is all of the inherited data coming from? what is the relationship between where theyre comign from and how theyre used?
    govt -> corporate

the ways in which the answer to your question is more about your question than your observation

statistics comes from "state"

- dont spend millions of man hours to gather data because its fun. u do it to answer questions

structures that gather together large pieces of data
- tied to prediction and managing populations and resources

observe your actor's categories
-  languages and frameworks that her subjects are thinking of it
- anthropoligical opportunity to directly interrogate them (SECRETLY ;-) )

hear ppl talk about these problems: where are their assumptions? what are the axioms that they are operating from? in industry?
- industry fairness 


TASK: observe your actor's categories.


## questions to think about
- why does history matter? how can we use it to help ppl to have conversations about just ways to help ? and ways to exist in these spaces?
