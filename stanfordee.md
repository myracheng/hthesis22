 ### engineering
data science is under EE under information systems
    - "In addition to work on the core disciplines of information theory and coding, communications and networking, control and optimization, signal processing, (radar) remote sensing machine learning and inference, our research in this area spans several application areas, including biomedical imaging, optical communications, wireless communications and networks, multimedia communications, Internet, energy systems, transportation systems, computational imaging and display systems, and financial systems."
        - radar
    - all the profs r pretty new (got phd in like >199x) except [boyd](https://profiles.stanford.edu/stephen-boyd)
            - While at Stanford, he has consulted with numerous Silicon Valley tech companies, and founded one. 
            -He serves in an advisory capacity for BlackRock, an investment management corporation;[24] Petuum, a machine learning platform for artificial intelligence;[25] and H2O.ai, open source machine learning platform
                - director of the Information Systems Laboratory, chair of the (university wide) Library Committee, chair of the David Packard EE Building Planning & Design Committee, and as a member of the (university wide) Advisory Board.
                
[ISL](https://isl.stanford.edu/about.html)
ISL was formed in the early 1960s by Norm Abramson, Gene Franklin, and Bernie Widrow as the Systems Theory Laboratory. The name was changed to ISL soon after Tom Kailath joined the faculty in 1964, in the words of Gene, “… on the basis that the group emphasized the study of systems rather than devices, manipulated information rather than energy, and applied mathematics rather than physics …”
### widrow: 
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Widrow invented LMS -> backprop
- https://ethw.org/Oral-History:Bernard_Widrow#Childhood_and_education how he got into AI from radio... conspicuously absent. bell labs, lincoln labs
- "Scientist, Professor, Entrepreneur"
    - got his start in AI from Dartmouth workshop [source](http://www.uncini.com/dida/aaml/dida_mat/2005_Widrow_Thinking%20about%20thinking_the%20discovery%20of%20the%20LMS%20algorithm.pdf) [[dartmouth]]
    - Use of the LMS algorithm really took off after the invention of the adaptive equalizer by R.W. Lucky and the adaptive echo canceller by M.M. Londhi and A.J. Presti at Bell Telephone Laboratories in the 1960s and 1970s. These were among the enabling technologies that made the Internet possible. Today, 45 years after its discovery, the LMS algorithm is still the world’s simplest and most widely used learning algorithm

### [SDSI](https://sdsi.stanford.edu/news)
founded in 2014 
data science for [education, x, yy, z, eeconomics..]
The Stanford Data Science Initiative aims to make Stanford a data enabled university. The Initiative advances data science methods and tools, and weaves them into the fabric of the university, to effectively respond to our most pressing societal and scientific challenges.
