And there’s one story about it that I don’t know whether you have ever heard. When I started out to do that book, I decided, “Well, 300 pages seems like a nice size for a book,” and that’s about 600 manuscript pages typed double-spaced. So I laid out a bunch of chapters, and I had, I guess, maybe 12 chapters, and that turned out to be about 50 manuscript pages per chapter. So I was going along and doing different chapters at different times. And one day, I was about to get ready to start on FORTRAN, and I got very depressed, and I thought, “I do not want to write 50 pages on FORTRAN; I’m just not that interested in FORTRAN.” And I got very depressed, “What have I gotten myself into?” because IBM was giving me all the time and resources to do this. Well, I shifted and I worked on some other section. All of a sudden I realized, “Jean, you have to do better arithmetic.” It was 50 pages per chapter, (not per language)! The chapter that FORTRAN was in also had ALGOL plus all the early languages (about seven or eight), and some other minor languages. So, I didn’t have to write 50 pages on FORTRAN when I was taking my graduate courses, I had to read that book.</p></blockquote></li></ul></li></ul><p>10-page biography by tim derbin (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4802436">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4802436</a>)</p><ul><li>The book project began in 1965 and by 1967, she had completed the manuscript of her seminal 785 page book, Programming Languages: History and Fundamentals, 23 which became an instant classic in the field, and has served as a ‘‘desk reference’’ for anyone writing about programming languages ever since</li><li>6 Believing that having an historian on the committee was essential to ‘‘getting the right history and getting the history right,’’ Jean asked Henry (Hank) Tropp to serve as conference historian.</li><li>started HOPL conference</li></ul><p>Jean Sammet described how she had to look in the men’s section, under Engineering, to find programming jobs. The fact that employers were willing to hire Sammet shows that the problem wasn’t just prejudice against women, it was a structural issue of: where do you run the ads so that women will actually see them? This is an issue that’s still relevant today: are IT recruiters going to where the women are?

That was practical stuff. Not only was it dull, we felt, but demeaning to pure mathematicians.” Jean Sammet, interview by Janet Abbate, August 29, 2001.</p><p>But Hopper was hardly alone as a female software innovator.
