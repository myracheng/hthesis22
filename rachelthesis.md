the social, cultural, and political forces that shaped the research, development, and use of AI technologies in the twentieth century

complex interactions between intellectual trends, government policies, social norms, and funding opportunities, in addition to the particular cultures of the labs, companies, and engineers that influence the development of certain technologies instead of others. T

made to the development of artificial intelligence as a field of research in the twentieth century

double vision of Murphy: 

historicizing these past feminist efforts as one might any other scientific endeavour, while doing
so from a point of *deep investment in feminist technoscience studies as a critical epistemological
and material project that values entanglement and sits in a genealogic relation to the practices
examined.*

Donan Haraway 4 frameworks:
1) social constructivism,  rejects positivistic
notions of reality
2) marxist feminism, marxist analyses of wage labor, racial hegemony
2)  epistemologies of working scientists
4) consider ways race and gender shape our lenses
QQ huh

technofeminist framework: gender and technology mutulaly shape each other
- gender relations are materialized in tech
- masc/fem acquire meaning through embeddedness in working machines

counter the narrative that machine learning and image
processing are the only techniques and applications of AI research
- speech, sound, and other environmental information. stop centering visual perception

vast portion of attention and humanistic scholarship about AI
has focused on the histories and developments of visual pattern recognition. 

ocularcentrism

speech, sound, and language are central.

Grosz became expert in comp methods for language

1st chapter: pre-history, culture of 2 stanford AI labs
SRI: target for student movements --> stanford divested form SRI
SAIL: transcendent haven,
physically and intellectually distant from the political unrest happening on campus
- SAIL’s disk backups seem to illustrate is a culture of
misogyny and deep indifference to women’s issues in AI research
- particular,
narrow, and masculine imagination of collaboration, collectivity, and inclusion in AI research.

Barbara Grosz and her colleagues created networks of
support, feminist protocols, and new research methods to change how AI research was done.

 She does not question assumptions of rational agency, nor does she
problematize symbolic AI’s fundamental goal to represent “the truth” about “the world” in a
computer system. I consider the limits of this feminist AI protocol, multi-agent or not, without a
deeper commitment to feminist epistemologies

## ch 1
SAIL’s culture
promoted a vision of collaboration through techno-optimism, either ignoring contemporary
political issues or actively coopting their language for their own interest


accounts of SAIL doing weird thigns related to sex "ZOE"

, it is precisely this culture of sexual humour— about
women being willing or unwilling to engage in sex acts— which was such a major target in the
reports women wrote in the 1980s and 1990s about harassment, alienation, and exclusion in their
computer science and engineering departments


 The woman unwilling to pose was
declared “not liberated enough.” This points to a fundamental misunderstanding of women’s
agency, consent, and the broader goals of feminist movement

Zoe may have happily posed for
the photos as a liberated woman, comfortable with her body— but that is what makes it feminist,
not the consumption and management of the pictures by men

## Chapter 2
broader network of AI researchers who enacted a similar kind of protocol feminism
within their computer science departments in the 1980s and 1990s

- did a bunch of things, like y advocated for the status of women in computer science 


as a student at MIT:
 women must not only build and show
confidence and competence, just as their male counterparts do, but unlike the men, they must
decide first to unlearn their normal behaviour patterns

based at places like Harvard and Upenn, which had much smaller departments

QQ how did u find

QQ ocularcentrism

QQ 4 frameworks

- rs created a feminist AI protocol in the last decades of the twentieth
century to change the scientific cultures of their universities, to improve working conditions of
women scientists, and to expand the kinds of research included in the umbrella of AI research. 

-  Only certain
disciplines were included in the interdisciplinarity of their approaches: primarily computer
science, linguistics, and other fields related to cognitive science like analytic philosophy and
cognitive psychology. As I will elaborate in the next chapter, concepts from these fields can
expand what is included in AI research, but only in certain directions

t I have not found any public discussion by these members about how US-Israel collaborations
in computer science relate to human rights issues in Israel and Palestine

## ch 3 
encoding concepts like agency, collaboration, human-computer relations

-  does not question the claims of universal truths, computational models
of the mind, and the myth of the homo economicus dominant in AI research in the twentieth
century.
    MC so she still criticizes its

going beyond master slave
- unsual framework for thinking about huma-AI relations

look at first annual GHC

reinforces many of the hierarchical relations dominant in AI
research. It is still humans making the goals, and AI systems still work for them

chinese room argument = stochastic parrots argument

building systems that can go “off-script,” the way she grounds her
approach in the diverse goals and desires of real users

- have to be familiar with feminisnt and critical STS to make these comparisons

AI, especially strong AI, is in epistemological terms
essentially conservative, preserving socially legitimated knowledge and offering limited scope
for considering of alternative forms of knowledge— in particular for this discussion— seeing
knowledge in terms of gender.

This assumes one universal human experience,
leaving little room for critical exploration of the way cultures, histories, and social forces shape
the very categories of what is considered “human.”
