# Grace hopper
- programmed harvard mark i (first programmable computer, used in the war)
    - he first programmers of the Mark I were computing pioneers Richard Milton Bloch, Robert Campbell, and Grace Hopper
    - used for war work, including computation of ballistic tables, Bessel tables for electronics and other applications, and calculations used by the Manhattan Project for development of the atomic bomb

Hopper sits squarely in the middle of the MIA complex, with significant influence in academia, industry and the U.S. Navy as a naval officer. She had many technical contgraceributions, such as inventing one of the first linkers, and was a pioneer in the field of programming languages, inventing COBOL and the underlying theory that enabled it. 
^ MC this isn't true

In the Navy, she was "initially rejected because of her age and diminutive size, but she persisted and eventually received a waiver to join the U.S. Naval Reserve." This biography tells a story of \textit{persistence} in the face of the restrictions and challenges thrown at her by the system, giving her an autonomy that implies that by the sheer force of will, she was able to overcome obstacles.... 
This begs the questions:
- how did she justify the exemption?

Later, she turned down a professorship at Vassar to work under a Navy contract at Harvard.\cite{shell2002improbable}
- MC why did she make this choice?

"She was well known for her lively and irreverent speaking style, as well as a rich treasury of early war stories. She also received the nickname "Grandma COBOL"
- MC did her close alignment with war stories enable her fame?

Grace hopper book
“*classic Hollywood-style tale:* a young, bright-eyed mathematics professor leaves her job to serve her country during World War II and serendipitously finds herself at the forefront of the computer revolution, facing technical challenges and gender discrimination”

**reverse salient** for advancing the idea of equity
“Thomas Hughes’s term “reverse salient” describes the critical lag point that hinders a given technological system from advancing. “Salient” is a military term for a bulge that occurs when, in the advance of a battle line, a segment of the army moves more rapidly than the surrounding units.”

“Grace Murray Hopper Collection in the Archives Center of the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of American History in Washington”


went to military because patriotic, wanted technical challenge

As her friend Berkeley so aptly put it, “it was the intensity of Hopper’s strengths…that paradoxically fueled her addiction,” (Beyer 205). Essentially, heroism enhanced Hopper’s addiction. Hopper’s issues with depression and alcoholism are often brushed aside to maintain her “hero” status.

 ^ what im trying to do with grace hopper

im trying to show how the grace hopper narratie perpetuates rather than erases inequalities 



then who gave hopper the voice?

## awards
62: IEEE and AAAS fellow
1964: Hopper was awarded the Society of Women Engineers Achievement Award, the Society's highest honor, "In recognition of her significant contributions to the burgeoning computer industry as an engineering manager and originator of automatic programming systems."[48] In May 1955, Hopper was one of the founding members of the Society of Women Engineers[49]

"really good at selling these technologies"

Grace Murray Hopper was one of the first computer programmers to work on the Harvard Mark I. She was also a United States Navy rear admiral, helped develop COBOL -- one of the first high-level programming languages -- and invented the first compiler, a program that translates programming code to machine language.Mar 12, 2015
- but neither of these are true
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler#History she isn't the first

A recent study from the nonprofit Women Who Code and online educator Pluralsights found that among the women it surveyed, one of the biggest obstacles in their careers was the lack of role models. There’s an adage that goes, “you can’t be what you can’t see” and role models like Hopper and Hamilton could show that a path forward is possible.

COBOL 1959

MC why was she in the position to sell COBOL to the navy?
- cuz she was already in the navy

TODOs:
- why 1964 award?

- perseverance
She proposed a program (called a ‘compiler’), which would take well defined construction orders as input and then produce a machine-readable (executable) file independently. This suggestion was in fact such an innovative one that it was met with general disbelief by users, the prevalent opinion of the time being that computers were able to perform algebraic operations, but nothing more beyond that. However, this was an attitude Hopper was to repeatedly experience and it did not curtail her from pursuing her project.


- Among those most active in this technological development, Grace Hopper stood out by constantly striving to close the gap between developers and users. At a time when widely accessible computers were unimaginable to most users, she persisted in pushing these boundaries.

- worked for the navy until age 79

gave many talks

In 1969 the US Data Processing Management Association awarded its first annual ‘Man of the Year’ Award for outstanding contributions to the information processing industry.


## blurry....
n 1944, Grace Hopper, a 37-year-old math Ph.D., joined the Navy as a lieutenant and was assigned to that lab. Her group also included the soon-to-be famous mathematician John von Neumann, and together they laid down some of the fundamental principles of computation. (Some historians actually argue that von Neumann took credit for Hopper’s ideas at the time.)

Did the programming world fall over itself to hail Grace Hopper for her brilliant revolution? No. Quite the opposite, in fact. The head of computer operations at General Electric, Herb Grosch, led a vocal resistance movement for more than a decade. They argued that programming was far too delicate and ingenious an activity for any part of it to be left to the computer itself. It was clear to Hopper that programmers regarded themselves as “high priests,” jealously guarding their status as intermediaries between ordinary people and the occult computer brain. They felt that her compiler was a threat to their status. “Well, you see,” she said later, “someone learns a skill and works hard to learn that skill, and then if you come along and say, ‘You don’t need that, here’s something else that’s better,’ they are going to be quite indignant.”


Hopper spent a decade writing papers and giving conference talks while the computing priesthood tried to smack her down, but the tide only really began to turn when she appealed directly to business executives, the potential users of her product. To them she promised greater speed, efficiency, and ease. One of her early compilers was called “Business Language version 0,” which reflected her idea that programming could be made transparent and simple enough for office workers to understand. Her strategy finally worked. By the end of the decade, payroll and inventory applications were being written at various military departments and industrial corporations with Hopper’s own language, FLOW-MATIC — a system that hardcore programmers still mocked because it was too easy for ordinary people to understand.

nother source of resistance to Grace Hopper’s innovations is still all too recognizable today — sexism. In 1960, Hopper participated, along with several other female computing pioneers, in the development of the computing language COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language). The majority of the elite computing “priesthood” predicted its rapid demise. According to one historian of technology, many of the skeptics had “concluded that the fruits of such an unstructured, female-dominated process could not be expected to survive, let alone flourish.” (By the year 2000, notwithstanding such prophecies, it was estimated that COBOL constituted about 240 billion out of the 300 billion lines of computer code in the whole world.) Yet things improved rapidly, in part thanks to Hopper’s own example. By 1968, according to an article in Cosmopolitan titled “The Computer Girls,” there were more than 20,000 women programmers working in the U.S., and there was demand for as many more: In this field, it said, sex discrimination was rare, and a woman could be “fully accepted as a professional.”

Grace Hopper was able to succeed in a number of male-dominated institutions: the Navy, the computing industry. And yet she never considered herself a feminist. I have a clip in my documentary where she's asked by an interviewer, "What have you made of the women's [liberation] movement of the last 20 years?" And she said: "I don't know much about it 'cause I didn't have to worry about it. I was in the Navy."



GRACE HOPPER: Well, it had to be the Navy because my great-grandfather was a rear admiral, besides which I like blue.

- she was extremely put together, contrast to biographies of other CS heroes [[artificialunint]]

Janet Abbate's review of Breyer's biography: (file:///Users/m/Downloads/abbate2010.pdf, https://sci-hub.do/https://doi.org/10.1007/s11016-010-9418-z)
- The historiography of computing has more than its share of ‘‘great man’’ accounts
lionizing inventors and business leaders. Only two women have received similar
treatment: the 19th-century mathematician Augusta Ada King, Countess of
Lovelace (for whom the Ada programming language was named), and Grace
Murray Hopper, whose long and colorful career as a computer pioneer and US Navy
Admiral made her the most recognizable female name in computing
- ‘‘it was Hopper’s collaborative abilities rather than her rebellious nature that created the space for her
independent thought and action within potentially hostile organizations’’ (4–5). He
emphasizes her abilities to maintain morale among co-workers, mediate disputes,
manage workers, bring together dispersed members of the computing community,
and convince others that her particular vision of software development was the right
future for the industry
- points out both the barriers raised by sexism (for example, Harvard’s
refusal to hire women faculty) and Hopper’s strategies for *overcoming* them
- her authority as a Naval officer provided a counterweight to gender bias
and that she drew on her social skills and technical prowess to build support from
male colleagues
- Beyer spends much time
trying to demonstrate that Hopper’s work may have influenced other figures such as
Maurice Wilkes, who is often credited with inventing subroutines, or John von
Neumann, who is associated with the stored-program concept. While Beyer’s
meticulous research makes these claims plausible (if not entirely convincing), by
focusing so much on apportioning individual credit he misses the opportunity to
understand how the larger computing community perceived and addressed the
problems of software development
criticisms:
-  Beyer overstates the uniqueness of the Harvard Mark I and the
programming methods developed for it.
