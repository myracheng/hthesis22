1) a high-level (maybe 1- to 5-sentence) summary of what the larger project is
 2) a closer-grain description of some particular thing that you're thinking through or working on at the moment (anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes, depending on how much you want to share).


## high level:
My project is focused on computer science research, specifically related to data science and artificial intelligence. I'm looking at the tensions between the camera-ready narratives of how computer science is innovating and changing the world for the better, versus the realities of its dominant values that exclude a lot of populations and is weaponized for military purposes.

I'm taking a historical approach at looking at this issue. 

<!-- I've been looking at the tensions between the camera-ready* narratives versus the lived realities at the frontiers of machine learning research. -->


## closer-grain:
military–industrial–academic complex
 - military funding
 - also the culture excludes women

women have adopted these values in order to succeed in these cultures, in turn buttressing them.
    - a lot of women who are  idolized as trailblazers, the narratives of them dont actually challenge the system
- for example, grace hopper: is squarely in the middle of MIA, she was a naval officer, also very assertive and persevered against the odds
    - lets actually fix the oldds
- another person is katherine johnson: assertive, "one of the boys"
- telle whitney, adapts to the culture and to her bosses (caltech archives)


for these women, "dark story" of how their stories are still within the system

cs for social good rn is within the system. different from CPSR. --> find contrasts between them

*TODO find women otuside of the system*
- previously: women cant be outside of the system? 

*read mar hicks*

these conditions that act to excldue women
    - but then womens responses to those buttress or challenge those conditions?


re: women in tech
before, it was chalelngign the system to just *exist* (black liberation) --> now it's not, insufficient for making actual change

re: purpose of tech research
before, CPSR: saying that we shouldnt do it for war. (explicitly a negation)
versus now, "cs for social good" is still within the system
--> should i just take this part out?

grace hopper's narrative: make computing accessible by making it in common language.
- radically changes programming's accessibliity == activism? (https://wiki.c2.com/?ActivistProgrammer)

- timnit: activism, was working at large tech companies but got flamed by them

** under what frameworks r these people activists or not*

Richard Stallman is an activist, there are examples of male activists in CS
- 

- but it's unfair to scrutinize individuals. instead ,we are scrutinizing how these ppl's stories are told ?
