 Occupational feminization in the sciences fostered long-term invisibil

 The terms hard and soft, as used to describe gendered tasks, are significant. For
 the hard and soft sciences, hard mastery and soft mastery are binary distinctions in sci

 ways of knowing are more feminine.

Yet, as Milkman suggests, more women in the labor market did not nec
 essarily mean more equality with men. Sexual divisions of labor persisted
 during wartime. The geography of women's work settings changed, but the
 new technical positions did not extend up the job ladder.

Margaret Rossiter, Women Scientists in America: Before Affirmative Action,
1940-1972 (Baltimore, 1995), 13, confirms this practice more widely in the sciences. The few women who worked in supervisory roles generally supervised other women, a much less prestigious managerial role than supervising men.

In a number of laboratories, scientists described
 women not as individuals, but rather as a collective, defined by their lab
 leader ("Cecil's Beauty Chorus") or by their machines ("scanner girls").
 Likewise in the ENIAC project, female operators are referred to as "[John]
 Holberton's group" or as "ENIAC girls."

 recognition and career advancement.

 ning of "wartime labor shortage" was circumscribed even as it came into being. While college
 educated engineers considered the task of computing too tedious for them
 selves, it was not too tedious for the college-educated women who made up
 the majority of computers.18 These were not simply cases of women taking
 on men's tasks, but rather of the emergence of new job definitions in light of
 the female workforce.

 ENIAC was project by APG in  Aberdeen
 - The APG housed the army's Ballis
 tic Research Laboratory (BRL), which produced range tables for gunners.
 During the war, BRL recruited approximately two hundred women to work
 as computers, hand-calculating firing tables for rockets and artillery shells

 Despite the complexities of preparing firing tables, in this feminized job
 category McNulty's appointment was rated at a subprofessional grade. The
 BRL also categorized women like Lila Todd, a computer supervisor when
 McNulty started work at the Moore School, as subprofessional.28
 Herman Goldstine recalls that BRL hired female computers almost exclusively

 t women's wartime contributions, particularly as members of
 the military. While "specially selected" for a "rather important" task these
 women were simultaneously "not trained persons" and could not enter
 "fully" into the BRL's work.

 Even as the WAC courses went on, Moore School engineers were design
 ing a machine to automate the production of the same firing and bombing
 tables calculated by the human computers: the ENIAC. Engineers wanted
 answers faster than women could supply them using available technologies.
 Yet ENIAC couldn't do everything itself. Programming equations into the
 machine required human labor.39 The

ENIAC 1945:
- With no precedents from either sex, the creation and gendering

 gather momentum. Computing was a female job, and other female clerical
 workers operated business machines. So it was not unusual that in July
 1945, women would migrate to a similar but new occupation

 of the development of ENIAC to consider primary source accounts of the
 work women actually performed reveals how its low-status categorization
 clashed with the kinds of knowledge required. Finding this mismatch
 offers the possibility that, in their work as operators, women moving into
 stereotypical male domains played a subversive role, challenging the gen
 der status quo before the war. A
