During the 1980s, historians including William Aspray, James Cortada, Paul Ceruzzi, and Michael Mahoney established an early and influential
vision for the history of computing that focused on men, machines, mathematical theories, and businesses. Refer to the Bibliography for selected examples
of their scholarship. A more recent popular account is Walter Isaacson, The
Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2015).
4. The most prominent account positioning computing as a “Cold War
technology” is Paul Edwards’s The Closed World: Computers and the Politics of Discourse in Cold War America (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1996). Others suggest
that the generous funding of the Cold War research economy allowed for creativity and a vibrant exchange of ideas. See, especially, Arthur Norberg, Judy
O’Neill, and Kerry Freedman, Transforming Computer Technology: Information
Processing for the Pentagon, 1962–1986 (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University
Press, 1996) and Atsushi Akera, Calculating a Natural World: Scientists, Engineers, and Computers during the Rise of U.S. Cold War Research (Cambridge, MA:
MIT Press, 2007).
