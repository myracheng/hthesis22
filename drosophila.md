# Is chess the drosophila of artificial intelligence? A social history of an algorithm

Nathan Ensmenger

- chess as drsoophila

computer chess

chess is simple enough to formalize mathematically, but complicated to be theoretically interesting Newell et al., 1958; Shannon, 1950)

drosophila - so certain research like transmissio ngenetics became dominant

chess: 
- approaches like deep tree and minimiax became relevant
- helped define identity and research agenda of AI

situate
the history of computer software – as an object of historical inquiry quite distinct from the
history of the computer itself – within the larger context of the history of science

minimax algorithm, the computational equivalent
to the drosophila chromosome ?? 

One obvious advantage of chess was that it was well-known and popular. This was not
true of alternatives such as Go, which despite being one of the most ancient of board games,
was not widely played outside of Asia
MC lol ok.

 Chess was a prestigious activity, long associated with intellectuals,
artists, and individual genius, as well as a grand metaphor for other complex human cognitive and social activities

turing shannon amateur players

coldwar - showdown b/w soviet and american

Deep Blue was too brute forrce. "breeding racing Drosophila" lolol
    - didnt produce new theories abt human cognitive processes or theoretical CS

the game is dfefined by minimax algorithm
players rely on perception, pattern recognition, heuristics

 Some researchers hope that alternative games such as Go might prove a more suitable experimental technology for producing
theories in AI, which are more applicable to more general problem domain
    - what new theories have GO generatd?? nothing

AI’s obsession with
games – and not any particular game – is the more fundamental problem, and that the discipline
needs to shift its focus from the manipulation of symbolic systems towards interaction with
the physical environment
