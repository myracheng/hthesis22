# The Cold War and American Science: The Military-industrial-academic Complex at MIT and Stanford by Stuart Leslie
QQ Why isnt Caltech in here!
Ch 6: slac
Ch 5 nuclear eng:
Sources:
Histories of specific laboratories/institustions

Mit copy caltech (134)

Had a lot more power in developing curriculum “develop physics at MIT”
Who is developing IDS now @ caltech?
Hiring decisions made. Existing professors going to industry
Rockefeller foundation / philanthropy unwilling to fund MIT since they were successful with industry. Mit branded as “science school”

Oil companies gave $ (like w Chicago)
QQ what happened there (144)

Lots of photographs

Cultural norms bc of professors’ interests
 || industry projects by profs

Failure of nuclear plane
“Academeic respectability conferred “

Nuclear engineering for increasing # of military officers detailed for advanced trainining

Resource & status at cost of independence. Military proejcts r (LNSE) natural and expected extension
Ch 3, 4:
Skimmed, seems like more specific examples?
Ch 2 beginnings at stanny
Talks about how Stanford used defense $ to build program that was able to recruit the smartest ppl + also build companies originating out of stanford. Ppl were happy to use defense $ since it meant more attention for their research. Unlike MIT where the military-funded labs were distinct and clear, Stanford had a system where ppl worked simultaneously on classified & unclassified projects, and seemingly “basic” research was all covertly funded by military.

To trace motivations of creation of educational programs/labs, uses a lot of correspondences and communications (e.g.a lot of the sources are communications/letters from the MIT and Stanford Archives, and are numbered like "MIT AC 4 132/8," "MIT AC 134 19", etc.)
Ch 1. Beginnings of EE at mit
Cites surveys, eg. The Making of a Profession: A Century cf Electrical Engineering in America 

Mit: electronics and electromagnetic theory at core, since this was what it was funded by
→ “obvious military implications “
→ partnership with defense contractor Sperry Gyroscope, gave thousands of $

Implications for MIT/outside support:
Roosevelt’s national defense research committee = civilian agency to contract defense research
Labs day to day management was by outsiders

“Engineering did not have the intellectual standing that science had” (EE head quote)

Rad Lab, aBell Labs military/industry/university partnership (Slater)
→ created interdepartmental research program
Headed by Stratton, who had many experiences and connections w/i and outside of MIT, recruited ppl from Rad Lab
Research associates at salaries competitive with industry
Needed $
Preparing for the Next War: American Plans for Postwar Defense, 1941-45 (New Haven: Yale University Press
Newly created office of naval research

“Those who were worried about domination by great industries… can now worry about domination by the military” 
Shapley, quoted in Kevles, The Physicists, p. 355

Research Laboratory of Electronics:
“Students took special pride in the degree of freedom”
Is freedom necessary?
“No restrictions on publishing… education as a top priority”
But ‘directed tied to military interests”
Participated in conferences /seminars funded by the military (26)
→ research became classified
From proposals like “Slater, "Proposed Physics Program for the Research Laboratory of Elec- tronics,”

Researchers are the “real war profiteers” since they get $

Military presence became “pervasive in local econ” 

Pattern of development: “evolution of industrial activity...carried forward by students who have gone into those industries” direct pipeline

Professors teach what they know → military-centered undergrad curricula

“Had not considered commercial problems directly” but influenced “conceptual and thematic level”

Financial independence and broadening scope → free MIT from “bondage of sponsored reserch” was a “mirage”

Military offered to double the budget → instant yes

Koreane War
Shaped by world events that military plays a role in

Looks bad if “avowed primary purpose is the air defense of the United Sates”
	-is it possible to get sources about intentions behind programs? Letters & communications? Details of negotiations

Justified lincoln lab as “threat of war e… major duty to the country”

Was “worlds best, or at least most expensive digital computer”
Continued to view itself as essential part of MITs educational mission
“Exploited its academic image for recruiting” “establishing professional reputation of laboratory”

MITRE: nonprofit corporation to manage SAGE
Concern about lincoln: motivated by defense not education

RLE used as “model of excellence”. 
Ford Foundation gave $10m for revision of engineering program
Smullin wanted to build for civilian technology, but received no support
Reframed as economic competitiveness (civilian counterpart to DARPA)
