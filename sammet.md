Lois Haibt, a contemporary of Sammet’s at IBM, where Sammet worked for nearly three decades, observed, “They took anyone who seemed to have an aptitude for problem-solving skills – bridge players, chess players, even women.”

Sammet became one of the most prominent women of her generation in computing. Her deepest interest was in programming languages and using them to open computing to a wider audience. Her ambition, Ben Shneiderman, a computer scientist at the University of Maryland, recalled her saying, was “to put every person in communication with the computer”.

president of ACM

As it evolved, Sammet pushed to inject more engineering discipline into the language to make it more useful and reliable in industries such as banking, health care and retailing, and for government agencies.


wrote an article called "The Real Creators of COBOL"

l. She assisted in creating the AFIPS journal, Annals of the History of Computing in 1978

Jean wrote her own history of programming languages, and of grace hopper, was also ACM president
Jean’s book, https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/361454.361485
The list of “prominent people” on Wikipedia in programming languages has Grace, but not Jean
contrast to grace hopper: very into museums lol

Sammet: unable to be in academia


ORAL HISTORIES:
[JEAN E. SAMMET Oral History by Thomas J. (Tim) Bergin, Ph.D.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1141880.1243440) (bkmk p. 15)
-  "first interview will focus on Jean’s early activities in the ACM"
    - unwilling to write about programming languages lol
        >The book that you and other people know of called PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES: History and Fundamentals, was published by Prentice-Hall in 1969.9
        > Other people have called it an instant classic and a standard and so forth. And there’s one story about it that I don’t know whether you have ever heard. When I started out to do that book, I decided, “Well, 300 pages seems like a nice size for a book,” and that’s about 600 manuscript pages typed double-spaced. So I laid out a bunch of chapters, and I had, I guess, maybe 12 chapters, and that turned out to be about 50 manuscript pages per chapter. So I was going along and doing different chapters at different times. And one day, I was about to get ready to start on FORTRAN, and I got very depressed, and I thought, “I do not want to write 50 pages on FORTRAN; I’m just not that interested in FORTRAN.” And I got very depressed, “What have I gotten myself into?” because IBM was giving me all the time and resources to do this. Well, I shifted and I worked on some other section. All of a sudden I realized, “Jean, you have to do better arithmetic.” It was 50 pages per chapter, (not per language)! The chapter that FORTRAN was in also had ALGOL plus all the early languages (about seven or eight), and some other minor languages. So, I didn’t have to write 50 pages on FORTRAN
        > when I was taking my graduate courses, I had to read that book.

- The book project began in 1965 and by 1967, she had completed the manuscript of her seminal 785 page book, Programming Languages: History and Fundamentals, 23 which became an instant classic in the field, and has served as a ‘‘desk reference’’ for anyone writing about programming languages ever since
- 6 Believing that having an historian on the committee was essential to ‘‘getting the right history
and getting the history right,’’ Jean asked
Henry (Hank) Tropp to serve as conference
historian.
- started HOPL conference


Jean Sammet described how she had to look in the men’s section, under Engineering, to find programming jobs. The fact that employers were willing to hire Sammet shows that the problem wasn’t just prejudice against women, it was a structural issue of: where do you run the ads so that women will actually see them? This is an issue that’s still relevant today: are IT recruiters going to where the women are? (https://mitpress.mit.edu/blog/recoding-gender-and-leaning-qa-janet-abbate)


 computer pioneer Jean Sammet recalled that when
she was a graduate student in math at the University of Illinois from 1948 to
1951, she and her fellow math students felt “contempt” at the thought of working with the university’s computers, which they equated with routine drudgery:
“We considered that sort of one step above garbage collecting. That was practical
stuff. Not only was it dull, we felt, but demeaning to pure mathematicians.” Jean
Sammet, interview by Janet Abbate, August 29, 2001.

But Hopper was hardly alone as a female software innovator.
One could equally well ask why women such as Nora Moser, Jean Sammet, and Mary Hawes had not earned a place at the table when software
improvements were being discussed (recoding Gender)

|| to grace:
- Ms. Sammet became one of the most prominent women of her generation in computing. Her deepest interest was in programming languages and using them to open computing to a wider audience. Her ambition, Ben Shneiderman, a computer scientist at the University of Maryland, recalled her saying, was “to put every person in communication with the computer.” (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/04/technology/obituary-jean-sammet-software-designer-cobol.html)
- Grace Hopper, a computer pioneer at Sperry Rand in the late 1950s, led the effort to bring computer makers together to collaborate on the new programming language. Ms. Hopper is often called the “mother of COBOL,” but she was not one of the six people, including Ms. Sammet, who designed the language — a fact Ms. Sammet rarely failed to point out. (Ms. Sammet worked for Sylvania Electric at the time.)
- The keynote speaker was Grace Murray Hopper. Jean Sammet said that ‘‘it took us about
two seconds to decide that she was the appropriate person to give the keynote address.’
- Given Jean’s industrious nature, no one who knew her believed that she would ever retire. However, motivated by changes at IBM, she officially retired at the end of 1988.
- “When I was still quite junior, Jean Sammet was the president of the ACM, and so there didn’t seem to be any barriers at the top for women in that organization.”

Jan Lee, in his book, said: In those positions, she played a key role in restoring ACM to a
healthy financial condition.14
