# Bourne

* Inspired by beard, dewey (same as boguslaw below)

* “Refusla to invest the war with a holy misison to make the world safer for democracy”

	* Petrifying the status quo

“War sentiment from ranks of big business cagught hold of one another of intellectual groups” (4)

“Intellectual veneer of their socialism” 7

### The State:
* Country is an inescapable group into whic hwe are born. (+)

* State is a concept of power/competition. Mixed up with country (68)

69:
* Government is machinery by which nation carries out its state functions

* War is th ehealth of the state. It brings the ideal of the state out into very clear relief

* State is medium for political salvation. Its *idealism* is a rich blod flowing … necessity for universality most unquestioned

	* State becomes the inexorable arbiter and determinant of mens businesses and attitudes and opinions

		* No citations… 

70: classes able to play an active role in war get a tremendous liberation of activity and energy. Sense of rejuvesecne criticism of state bad
71: other values such as artistic creation, knowledge, are instantly and almost unamnimously sacrificied
The state is intimiatlye connected with war, creates a collective community: nomos!
### What is exploitation?
* Something shameful, something consciously brutal about industrial relations

	* He has workmen who do their work at night the year round. He is sorry. He wishes thesethings did nto have to be… he will not admit that any one is “specifically to blame.” they come freely to him and ask for employment. The stockholders have built a factory and not a philanthropic institution. My friend cannot imagine a man being willingly exploited. Systematic, prevalent industrial exploitation - my friend has never seen

* Describes his own personal experience being in monopoly / no choice but to accept a low wage

	* As long as i continued at work noting could have removed my sense of helplessness

	* I have always felt the power of my employer to skim it

* The employer is entrenched in property rights with the armed state behind him

	* “He recognizes individuals, I recognize classes. He trusts rights, I trust power. He thinks of exploitation as personally brutal, not inherent in a system”

### The Idea of a University
Situation at Columbia of Beard’s dismissal because of his opposition to war
* The university has become a financial corporation, strictly analogous, in its motives and response, to the corporation which is concerned in the production of industrial commodities

	* Trustees, who are business men, carry over into the management of the university the attitudes and sensitivities learned in the corporate world

		* Their obligation is to see that the quality that university produces seems reputable to the class which they represent

			* Want to increase prestige of university

Professors associated themselves with organizations that were neg association in public.
On stock exchange it isi by rumor and prejudice that hte value of securities are hit
* Not the discontent of idealists, but vague complaints from parents, complainants from business men

	* In such a system, the professor becomes a mere employee of a company which has a standing to maintain in the corporate world

Myth of “institution of learning” - professors should be free to explore, etc
* But under trustee control, the American university becomes a private commercial corporation

“We have come to the time when Americans will have to choose between the current philosophy of uni government and the presence of in the university of independent and vigorous minds”
* MC But this can co exist … 

A revolution in the idea of a university cannot come too quickly
The public must learn to distinguish between his academic functions and his private opinions and activities. He will scarcely be free as long as he is vulnerable for activities which in no ways concern his academic work
* WB political views

State control is no solution, so long as directorship is given to men with the current corporate attitudes

What is needed is a clear realization of the hostility of the system of ideas which govern university control, and the functional and cooperative ideals which should govern a communiti devoted to learning

*militarization*
