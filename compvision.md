Thus we find, again, the legacy of world war in the sciences of mind
and brain: the human capacities of perception and thought as the
design features of technological soldiers

- the father of Computer Vision is Larry Roberts, who in his Ph.D.
thesis (cir. 1960) at MIT discussed the possibilities of extracting 3D geometrical information from
2D perspective views of blocks (polyhedra) 
- A major milestone was the framework proposed by David Marr (cir. 1978) at MIT,
who took a bottom-up approach to scene understanding [2].

A third pole of innovation was occurring at universities where sophisticated research machines would be built over the next decade. All three kinds of military-type computingâ€”government-sponsored, commercially-produced, and academically guided, had the Cold War as their backdrop.


CV: a lot of stuff from human visual rpocessing (so also military history of biology)
