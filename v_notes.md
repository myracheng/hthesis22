if everyone is commercializing their stuff, it bcomes natural for industry to partner with them.

prior WW II- federal funding is not a significant source

Shuki Bruck - He received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Electrical Engineering from the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, in 1982 and 1985, respectively and the Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University in 1989.


Dr. Bruck has extensive industrial experience, including working with IBM Research where he participated in the design and implementation of the first IBM parallel computer. He was a co-founder and Chairman of Rainfinity (acquired in 2005 by EMC), a spin-off company from Caltech that has created the first virtualization solution for Network Attached Storage. He was a co-founder and Chairman of XtremIO (acquired in 2012 by EMC), a start-up company that has created the first scalable all-flash enterprise storage system.

caltech archives - everything about IST
http://paradise.caltech.edu/bruck/IST.pdf:
- We’re drowning in data, from up-to-the-nanosecond stock quotes to blogs to digital sky catalogs and protein databases, but we can’t read or think any faster than we could 100 years ago. We need a new way of dealing with it all—another technological revolution, if you will. The computer revolution happened because there are explicit ways to translate a verbal concept—“let’s add two numbers”—into a mathematical expression—“x + y = z”—that can then be turned into a series of logical operations by Boolean algebra. A mathematician and electrical engineer named Claude Shannon realized that any Boolean expression could be built as a set of wires and relays. From there to the Pentium is a bit of a technological leap, but today, with a few clicks of the mouse, you can specify what you want a chip to do and a computer will design it for you. “And that’s why we can build things with a hundred million transistors,” says Bruck. “What we are missing is the ability to go backward.” Reverse-engineering things as diverse as nematodes and stock markets means bringing together people from many academic disciplines, which is a very Caltech thing to do. Bruck estimates that as many as one-quarter of the faculty will eventually participate in IST in some way

In order to do the type of research Anima Anandkumar does, she needs access to NVIDIA's (or similar) clusters
    - but why does she do that research?

Bell Labs is key. MSR, Google and FB Reseach, Netflix, etc. all just want to be Bell Labs.
