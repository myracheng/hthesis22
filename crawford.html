Looking back on this period, he admitted, “It wasn’t my idea to do this [affect research]. I was asked—pushed. I didn’t even write the research proposal. It was written for me by the man who gave me the money to do it.”30 In 1965, he was researching nonverbal expression in clinical settings and seeking funding to develop a research program at Stanford University. He arranged a meeting in Washington, D.C., with Lee Hough, head of ARPA’s behavioral sciences division.31 Hough was uninterested in how Ekman described his research, but he saw potential in understanding cross-cultural nonverbal communication.3</p><p>. It turns out that Hough wanted to distribute his money quickly to avoid suspicion from Senator Frank Church, who had caught Hough using social science research as a cover for acquiring information in Chile that could be used to overthrow its left-wing government under President Salvador Allende</p><p>Because facial recognition emerged as a foundational application for artificial intelligence in the 1960s, it is not surprising that early researchers working in this field found common cause with Ekman’s approach to analyzing faces.</p><ol start="0"><li>Bledsoe, “Model Method in Facial Recognition.”</li></ol><p>a rational, knowable, and measurable rubric suitable to laboratories, corporations, and governments</p><p>–&gt; uses historical controversy to talk about current stuff (stopped at p 177)</p><h1 id="ch-6">ch 6</h1><p>Snowden archive: most specific details about how machine learning began to be used in the intelligence sector, as led by some of the wealthiest governments in the world.</p><p>The U.S. intelligence agencies are the old guards of big data. Along with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, they have been major drivers of AI research since the 1950s.

The Third, according to Carter, should be a combination of AI, computational warfare, and robots.22 But unlike the NSA, which already had robust surveillance capabilities, the U.S. military lacked the AI resources, expertise, and infrastructure of America’s leading technology companies.23 In 2014, Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work outlined the Third Offset as an attempt to “exploit all the advances in artificial intelligence and autonomy.”24</p><p>To build AI war machines, the Department of Defense would need gigantic extractive infrastructures. Yet in order to gain access to highly paid engineering labor and sophisticated development platforms, partnering with industry was necessary. The NSA had paved the way with systems like prism, both working with and secretly infiltrating telecommunications and technology companies.25 But these more covert approaches faced renewed political pushback after the Snowden disclosures. Congress passed the USA Freedom Act in 2015, which introduced some limitations on the NSA’s access to realtime data from Silicon Valley. Yet the possibility for a larger military-industrial complex around data and AI remained tantalizingly close.
