John F. Kennedy's Executive Order issued March 16,
1981 which is usually seen as representing the real roots of
present day Affirmative Action policy
- simultaneously: civil rights bill (title vi, title vii)

80's: attempts to weaken affirmative action


AA as a women's issue:
- women are in the protected class since 1982
- - in all SC cases except _johnson_, women are not the protected class

in 1970 to 1972, big lowers were white women
-  As
a group, their "seeming decline" in income iS probably due to the
steady influx of relatively inexperienced female workers into the
labor force. Women as a group are better off but their average
income drops. 

- etween 1967 and 1980, the largest wage advances were achieved
by black women who went from eaniing 7 4% of the wage of
similarly employed white women in 1967 to almost complete
racial parity in 1980. 36 It has been suggested that "part of the
reason for nonwhite women's gains ... may be their having been
so badly off initially that their Jobs and incomes could improve
considerably without posing any real threat to the normal
f th "37 workings o e economy

Leonard: white women not benefiting
- these women
have so flooded the employment market that they have been
hired in J2.Q.!Ji.contractor and non-contractor companies. As he
says, "female [employment) share" has "increase[d) at all establishments because of the supply shift ... " Thus, his comparison
of contractor and non -contractor hiring does not show the
general large increase in white women hired. His explanation
seems plausible considering the clear increase in the number of
women employed which is reflected by Bureau of the Census data
for the period between 1970 and 1980.


Affirmative Action, with
its emphasis on numbers and "parity" can indirectly benefit
women (including white women) because it inevitably shifts our
focus from rhetoric to results.
