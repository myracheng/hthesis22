 1983 the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)-
 historically the foremost U.S. sponsor of research in artificial
 intelligence since the early 1960s-announced the Strategic Com-
 puting Initiative (SCI), a ten-year plan to develop artificial intelli-
 gence (AI) technologies for military systems

 ms. Whereas DARPA's
 past sponsorship of AI mostly had been limited to pure research,
 with only remote links to weapons systems, the SCI attempts to
 direct research more vigorously by aiming at specific military
 applications goals

 The SCI, with a proposed budget of $900 million over the
 period 1983-93, is by far the largest single source of funds for
 artificial intelligence research in the United State

 today. A funding
 source that could eventually dwarf even this huge contribution is

 The process of constructing knowledge about and with computers,
 in other words, is deeply enmeshed in funding decisions that are
 not only shaped by military prerogatives but also take place within
 institutional structures that preclude public deb
